zato stop
==========

Overview
------------

Stops a Zato component. 

If the component is a server, all the worker subprocesses will be stopped. If the server
has started any outgoing connectors, they will be stopped too.

Unlike the majority of other commands, *stop* doesn't merely print out OK on stdout
on a successful completion. Instead, full path to the component stopped is repeated
so that admins can quickly spot any mistakes and start back components that have
been erroneously stopped.
