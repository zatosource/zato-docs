SSL/TLS traffic to external applications
========================================

Key features:

* Services can invoke SSL/TLS-protected HTTP resources, including authentication using client certificates
* Target server certificates can be validated or ignored
* Everything can be configured on-fly without restarts nor coding

Tasks
-----

* :ref:`Uploading and updating client certificates <admin-tls-upload-client-certs>` for services to use when connecting to external HTTP resources
* :ref:`Uploading CA certificates <admin-tls-upload-ca-certs>`  used for validation of external applications' certificates

.. _admin-tls-upload-client-certs:

Uploading and updating client certificates
------------------------------------------

* Use :doc:`a dedicated form <../../../web-admin/security/tls/keys-certs>` to upload concatenated pairs of PEM certificate
  and private key for services to use through outgoing connections
  (:doc:`Plain HTTP <../../../web-admin/outgoing/plain-http>` or :doc:`SOAP <../../../web-admin/outgoing/soap>`).
  The material cannot be secured with a password.

* No restarts are needed after updating an already existing pair with a new one.

.. _admin-tls-upload-ca-certs:

Uploading and updating CA certificates
--------------------------------------

* Use :doc:`a dedicated form <../../../web-admin/security/tls/ca-certs>` to upload bundles of certificates, in PEM,
  to use for validating server certificates services will access through outgoing connections. A bundle may consist of one
  or more CA certificates, including any intermediate ones.

* No restarts are needed after updating an already existing bundle of certificates.
