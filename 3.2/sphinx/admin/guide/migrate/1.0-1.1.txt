Migrating from Zato 1.0 to 1.1
------------------------------

* :doc:`Install Zato 1.1 binaries <../install/index>` alongside 1.0 on each host any
  Zato component is on
  
* If using quickstart clusters - open zato-qs-start.sh and zato-qs-stop.sh scripts
  and set ZATO_BIN to zato, so its reads:
  
  :: 
  
    ZATO_BIN=zato
    
* Use 
  :doc:`zato stop <../../cli/stop>`
  and
  :doc:`zato start <../../cli/start>`
  to restart each component one by one - environments created with Zato 1.0
  can still use 1.1 binaries
  
* (end of steps)
