Load-balancer's statistics
==========================

`HAProxy <http://haproxy.1wt.eu/>`_, the underlying tool Zato's load-balancer is built on top of,
provides 
`statistics <http://cbonte.github.io/haproxy-dconv/configuration-1.5.html#9>`_
regarding its current and historical state, which servers
are up, how many clients there are, what is the transfer rate and similar data.

Note that the link to statistics requires a username/password combination be set in 
:ref:`the load-balancer's main config file <admin-guide-config-lb-main>`.
