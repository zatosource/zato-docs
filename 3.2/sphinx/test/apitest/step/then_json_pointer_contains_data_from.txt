Then JSON Pointer "{path}" contains "{value}"
==============================================

Usage example
-------------

::

    Feature: zato-apitest docs

    Scenario: Then JSON Pointer "{path}" contains "{value}"

        Given address "http://apitest-demo.zato.io"
        Given URL path "/demo/json"
        Given format "JSON"

        When the URL is invoked

        Then JSON Pointer "/hello" contains data from "expected.json"

Discussion
----------

/hello must be a JSON iterable, such as list - each element of the iterable
will be consulted for equality with the JSON value provided in file given
in the step - here "expected.json".

Assertion error is raised if none of the elements in iterable matches the contents
of the file.
