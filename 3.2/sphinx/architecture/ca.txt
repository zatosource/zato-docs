Certificate Authority (CA)
==========================

Zato CA's main purpose is to support the creation of :doc:`quickstart </admin/cli/quickstart-create>`
clusters. Even though it's technically possible to use the CA as a standard
solution in an organization, it's not really recommended and there are no plans
to develop the CA into a more feature-rich solution.

The CA is used through :doc:`the command line </admin/cli/ca>` and works by executing
`openssl <https://openssl.org/>`_ commands in subprocesses.

While purposefully limited in its extent, the CA still allows one to customize
the output of running the commands by updating the ./ca-material/openssl-template.conf
configuration file. 

It's perfectly fine to add, modify or remove some fields from this INI-style
config file - after substituting several basic fields, such as organization
or organizational_unit, Zato simply passed the file contents directly to openssl.

Note that unlike :doc:`web admin <./web-admin>`, :doc:`servers <./servers>`
and the :doc:`load-balancer <./load-balancer>`, the CA won't keep a history of updates
to the configuration file in a local repository, that is, there won't be any way
to automatically revert to a previous version of ./ca-material/openssl-template.conf
should things go awry.
