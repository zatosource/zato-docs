Service details - Slow responses
================================

Overview
--------

It's possible to :ref:`set a slow response threshold <web-admin-services-edit>`
for a service so that last 100 slow invocations of a service will be stored for 
a later inspection.

* Menu path: Services -> (find a service and clicks its name) -> Slow responses
* Example address: http://localhost:8183/zato/service/request-response/zato.service.invoke/?cluster=1

Request and response can be pretty-printed in order to ease with understanding
how they looked like.

.. note ::

  As with :doc:`sample requests/responses <./sample-req-resp>` - only the actual
  payload the service received/produced is shown - this is a caveat only
  services invoked through SOAP XML channels should be concerned with.
