Header        Notes
============= ==============================
Name          Name of the cluster
Description   Cluster's textual description
LB host       Host the load-balancer runs on
LB port       Load-balancer's port
LB agent port Load-balancer agent's port
============= ==============================

.. note ::

  Updating LB host, port and agent port merely notifies the web admin of where
  to find these components - it doesn't make them use new values provided.

.. _web-admin-cluster-delete:

Delete
------

.. image:: /gfx/web-admin/clusters/delete.png
   
Lets you completely delete every piece of information in the ODB regarding this
particular cluster.

All Zato components need to be :doc:`stopped <../../admin/cli/stop>` prior to using this form.

You need to confirm the deletion by:

* checking whether a name of the cluster is correct
* typing GO AHEAD

Only now it's possible to delete the cluster in the ODB.

.. warning ::

  This operation cannot be undone. Triple-check everything before you choose
  to delete a cluster.

Highlighting
------------

When navigating to the list of clusters from other parts of the application,
and if any has been selected, the row containing this cluster will be highlighted.

The row will also be highlighted if:

* The load-balancer's configuration couldn't be fetched - as though the load-balancer's
  XML-RPC agent wasn't running
  
* One or more servers in the cluster are down (as reported by HAProxy)

* All servers in the cluster are down (as reported by HAProxy)
