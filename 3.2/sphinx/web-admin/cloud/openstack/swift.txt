Cloud - OpenStack Swift
=======================

Overview
--------

Used to create, update, delete and browse through outgoing `OpenStack Swift <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amazon_S3>`_
such as `Rackspace Files <https://www.rackspace.com/cloud/files>`_ and implementations.

Connections can be used by services to access Swift containers and objects :doc:`in run-time <../../../progguide/examples/cloud/openstack/swift>`
or in :doc:`OpenStack Swift notifications <../../notif/cloud/openstack/swift>`.

* Menu path: Cloud -> OpenStack -> Swift
* Example address: http://localhost:8183/zato/cloud/openstack/swift/?cluster=1
