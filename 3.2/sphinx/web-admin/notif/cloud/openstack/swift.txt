Notifications - OpenStack Swift
===============================

Overview
--------

Used to create, update, delete and browse through
`OpenStack Swift <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OpenStack#Object_Storage_.28Swift.29>`_
notifications.

A notification is a definition of one or more Swift containers, including their folders,
that should be periodically read in order to find out if they contain any files and if so,
whether to obtain their payload.

A callback service is invoked each time a match is found. The service can be given either file names and metadata as well as
actual file contents on input. On response, the service can indicate that Zato should the file from Swift storage
itself, for instance, when it's not needed anymore.

A set of patterns can be applied so that only selected files will be taken into account.

Header              Notes
=================== ======================================================================================================================
Name                Definition's name
Active              Whether any data will be fetched through the underlying connection or not
Connection          An :doc:`OpenStack Swift connection <../../cloud/openstack/swift>` to use
Interval            In seconds. How often to fetch new data. Also, how often to check for changes to the notification's configuration -
                    it will take up to interval seconds for changes to take any effect.
Name pattern        Provide to the service only files whose name matches the pattern. If *Neg.?* is checked, match only files
                    with names that don't correspond to the pattern.
Service             Service to invoke when a matching file is found. Note that it will be invoked on each server in a cluster,
                    use self.lock to ensure if only one can processs the file. If the service assigns to self.response.payload
                    a dictionary with the key of {'delete':True} - the file will be deleted by Zato.
Containers          A list of one or more containers, along with directories, to read each time the notifier runs. Directories
                    are optional and if provided, should be separated by colon from the containers. If no directory is provided,
                    the top-level one is used - in that situation, no colon is needed, the name of a container suffices.
Get data            If checked, the service will receive the file contents on input. If pattern is provided, it will be given
                    the contents only if file names match the pattern. *Neg.?* negates the pattern.
