Channels - IBM MQ
===========================

Overview
--------

Used to create, update, delete and browse through IBM MQ channels.

Each channel represents a connection through which MQ messages are
received by Zato. A given service is invoked for each message received.

Creating or updating a channel (re-)establishes a connection to an MQ queue manager.

Reading messages off a queue and invoking a service is an asynchronous
activity - messages are not rolled back onto queues if there are any errors
along.

Delete

Stops a channel's connector and deletes the channel from ODB.

The 'Active' flag
-----------------

If a channel is made inactive, its underlying MQ connection
will be stopped but the connector itself will be still running.
