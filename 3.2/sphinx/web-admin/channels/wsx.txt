Name                Channel name
Active              :ref:`Documented below <web-admin-channels-wsx-active>`
Address             TCP address and URL path the channel should bind to. The port must be unique - there cannot be multiple
                    channels using the same port. Note that creating a channel will only make it available on servers and the
                    load-balancer needs to be configured separately, as in this
                    `article <https://zato.io/blog/posts/load-balance-http-web-sockets.html>`_.
Service             Name of a Zato service to invoke upon receiving each incoming message
Security definition *(Optional)* Name of a security definition to check credentials through while logging a WebSockets client in
New token wait time How much time, in seconds, clients have to log in with their credentials (if any) and receive the connection
                    token after they open an initial TCP connection. This is to prevent clients that open TCP stream which are
                    never used.
Token TTL           Each WebSocket connection is identified by a token, equivalent to a session cookie in HTTP. This value
                    is the token's Time To Live upon exceeding of which any subsequent invocations will be closed.
                    Each invocation of the channel extends TTL by that many seconds from current time.

Delete
------

.. image:: /gfx/web-admin/channels/wsx-delete.png

Deletes the channel from ODB and servers. The channel won't exist anymore and invoking
an address it was mounted on will return a TCP connection error.

.. _web-admin-channels-wsx-active:

The 'Active' flag
-----------------

If a channel is made inactive, its TCP socket will not be created, i.e. any attempts to connect to the channel's
port will result in a TCP connection refused error.
