Channels - ZeroMQ
==================

Overview
--------

Used to create, update, delete and browse through ZeroMQ channels.

Each channel represents a connection through which ZeroMQ messages are
received by Zato. A given service is invoked for each message received.

Creating or updating a channel (re-)establishes a connection to its underlying ZeroMQ socket.

Stops a channel's connector and deletes the channel from ODB.

If a channel is made inactive, its underlying ZeroMQ connection will be stopped
but the connector itself will be still running.
