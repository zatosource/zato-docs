Channels - AMQP
===============

Overview
--------

Used to create, update, delete and browse through AMQP channels.

Each channel represents a pool of connections through which AMQP broker messages are
received by Zato. A given service is invoked for each message received.

Name                Channel name
Active              :ref:`Documented below <web-admin-channels-amqp-active>`
Definition          :doc:`AMQP definition <../conn-def/amqp>` to read basic
                    connection information from
Queue               Name of the AMQP queue to fetch messages from
Consumer tag prefix Each channel can be given a prefix that can be used to
                    tell channels apart from AMQP's end, e.g. each Zato
                    environment can use a different one
Ack mode            In what way to acknowledge a message if the channel's service
                    does not do it explicitly
Prefetch count      QoS prefetch count set for connections created by this channel
Pool size           How many connections to create to the AMQP broker - note that this
                    value is for each Zato worker process rather than globally for
                    the whole Zato cluster
Service             Name of an already existing service to invoke for
                    each AMQP message received
Data format         *(Optional)* The expected data format Zato should parse
                    incoming messages as. This will also populate a service's
                    :ref:`data_format attribute <progguide-write-service-data_format>`.

Stops a channel's connector and deletes the channel from ODB.

If a channel is made inactive, its underlying AMQP connection will be stopped
but the connector itself will be still running.
