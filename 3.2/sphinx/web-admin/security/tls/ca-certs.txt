Conditions One or more CA certificates, in PEM.
========== ================================================================================================================

Each of the servers in a cluster stores the certificate(s) in its own *tls/ca-certs* configuration directory. For instance,
if a path to the server is /esb/server1 then the full path to the directory is */esb/server1/config/repo/tls/ca-certs*.

Having stored the certificate on file-system a server confirms the full path in server.log, such as below:

::

    INFO - CA certificate saved under `/esb/server1/config/repo/tls/ca-certs/C_AU__CN_CA2.pem`

Delete
------

Deletes a security definition and all the objects that make use of it.

.. note ::

  It needs to be emphasized that any outgoing connections that were using the definition will also be deleted automatically.
