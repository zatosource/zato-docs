Security - SSL/TLS
==================

Zato services can be secured with SSL/TLS and it's also possible to invoke SSL/TLS-secured resources.

Following chapters go through all the web-admin forms supporting the process of managing the crypto material:

* :doc:`Channels <channels>`
* Outgoing -> :doc:`CA certs <ca-certs>`
* Outgoing -> :doc:`Keys and certs <keys-certs>`

:doc:`A dedicated guide <../../../admin/guide/tls/overview>` provides detailed information on performing typical
tasks related to SSL/TLS keys and certificates.
