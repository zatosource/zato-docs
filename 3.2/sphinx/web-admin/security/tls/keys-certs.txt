Security - SSL/TLS - Outgoing - Keys and certs
==============================================

Overview
--------

Used to create, update, delete and browse `SSL/TLS <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transport_Layer_Security>`_
private keys and certificates that can be used by :doc:`Plain HTTP <../../outgoing/plain-http>` and :doc:`SOAP <../../outgoing/soap>`
outgoing connections to authenticate themselves to external resources.

* Menu path: Security -> SSL/TLS -> Outgoing -> Keys and certs

Name       Definition name
Conditions A concatenation of a certificate and private key, in PEM. For instance, the contents of everything.pem obtained
           as follows:

           .. code-block:: bash

             $ cat my.cert.pem my.key.pem > everything.pem

========== ================================================================================================================

Each of the servers in a cluster stores the unencrypted key/certificate pair in its own *tls/keys-certs*
configuration directory. For instance, if a path to the server is /esb/server1 then the full path to the directory
is */esb/server1/config/repo/tls/keys-certs*.

Having stored the key/certificate pair on file-system a server confirms the full path in server.log, such as below (broken out
into two lines for clarity):

::

    INFO Key/cert pair saved under \
      `/esb/s1/config/repo/tls/keys-certs/RSA__4096_bits__C_AU__CN_Cli4__emailAddress_Cli4.pem`

Delete
------

.. image:: /gfx/web-admin/security/tls/keys-certs-delete.png

Deletes a security definition and all the objects that make use of it.

.. note ::

  It needs to be emphasized that any outgoing connections that were using the definition will also be deleted automatically.
