Name       Definition name
Conditions A list of key/value pairs, each in its own line, representing fields in a client's certificate that must
           contain given values in order for an incoming request to be allowed. All conditions must be met otherwise
           a request will be rejected.

           Note that at the time when conditions are evaluated, the request has already been
           :doc:`accepted by the load-balancer <../../../admin/guide/tls/client-lb>`
           which validated the client certificate against known CA certificates.
