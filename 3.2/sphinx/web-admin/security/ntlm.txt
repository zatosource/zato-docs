A newly created security definition has a secret set to a random UUID4 and needs to be changed in order for 
the definition to be usable.

Change password
---------------

.. image:: /gfx/web-admin/security/ntlm-change-secret.png

Updates a definition's password - the password is stored in the ODB along with
other details of a security definition. This is not a required field and the password
can be omitted altogether if it's not needed at all.

Delete
------

.. image:: /gfx/web-admin/security/ntlm-delete.png

Deletes a security definition and all the connections that make use of it.

.. note ::

  It needs to be emphasized that any SOAP outgoing connections that were using the
  definition will also be deleted automatically.
