Security - API keys
===================

Overview
--------

Used to create, update, delete and browse API keys-based security definitions
used by REST
:doc:`channels <../channels/plain-http>`
or
:doc:`outgoing connections <../outgoing/plain-http>`.

Client applications provide API keys in custom, user-defined, HTTP headers forming, essentially, a username/password
pair where the header's name is a username and the header's value is a password.

It's not possible for two or more API key definitions to share the same header name.

Header Notes
====== ===================================================================
Name    Definition name
Header  Name of a custom HTTP header that will contain the API key's value
====== ===================================================================

A newly created security definition has a secret set to a random UUID4 and needs to be changed in order for
the definition to be usable.

Change API key
---------------

.. image:: /gfx/web-admin/security/apikey-change-secret.png

Updates a definition's API key - the key is stored in the ODB along with
other details of a security definition. This is not a required field and the key
can be omitted altogether if it's not needed at all.

Delete
------

.. image:: /gfx/web-admin/security/apikey-delete.png

Deletes a security definition and all the connections that make use of it.

.. note ::

  It needs to be emphasized that any plain HTTP channels or outgoing connections that were using the
  definition will also be deleted automatically.
