and needs to be changed in order to be usable.

Change password
---------------

.. image:: /gfx/web-admin/security/basic-auth-change-password.png

Updates a definition's password - the password is stored in the ODB along with
other details of a security definition. This is not a required field and the password
can be omitted altogether if it's not needed at all.

Delete
------

Deletes a security definition and all the connections that make use of it.

.. note ::

  It needs to be emphasized that any plain HTTP or SOAP channels and outgoing
  connections that were using the definition will also be deleted automatically.
