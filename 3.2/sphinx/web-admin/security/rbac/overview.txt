===========================================

:doc:`HTTP channels <../../channels/plain-http>`
can be secured with credentials grouped into roles forming hierarchies allowing or disallowing
client applications perform indicated actions against services.

Following chapters go through all the web-admin forms supporting the process of RBAC management:

* :doc:`Roles <roles>`
* :doc:`Client roles <client-roles>`
* :doc:`Permissions <permissions>`
* :doc:`Permissions for roles <role-permissions>`

:doc:`A dedicated guide <../../../admin/guide/rbac/overview>` provides detailed information on performing typical
tasks related to RBAC.
