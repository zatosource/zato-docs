Security - RBAC - Permissions
=============================

Overview
--------

Used for browsing, renaming or deleting existing permissions. In Zato 2.0 the set of permissions is fixed and cannot be expanded - 
there are no means to bring a permission back after it has been deleted.

* Menu path: Security -> RBAC -> Permissions
* Example address: http://localhost:8183/zato/security/rbac/permission/?cluster=1

Delete
------

Deletes the permission **permanently** - short of recreating a cluster there are no means to create a new permission, though
future Zato version will support it.
