A newly created security definition has its access key set to a random UUID4 and needs to be changed in order for 
the definition to be usable.

Change access key
-----------------

.. image:: /gfx/web-admin/security/aws-change-secret.png

Updates a definition's access key - the key is stored in the ODB along with
other details of a security definition. This is not a required field and the key
can be omitted altogether if it's not needed at all.

Delete
------

.. image:: /gfx/web-admin/security/aws-delete.png

Deletes a security definition and all the objects that make use of it.

.. note ::

  It needs to be emphasized that any AWS-related objects that were using the
  definition will also be deleted automatically.
