Outgoing connections - SOAP
===========================

Overview
--------

Used to create, update, delete and browse through outgoing SOAP connections.

Unlike :doc:`plain HTTP connections <./plain-http>`, SOAP ones always expect
that a service intends to send XML.

Header              Notes
=================== ======================================================================================================================
Name                Connection name
Active              Whether the connection can be used by services or not. 

                    If a connection is not active a service will encounter a 
                    `zato.common.Inactive <https://github.com/zatosource/zato/blob/support/2.0/code/zato-common/src/zato/common/__init__.py>`_
                    exception when attempting to use it.
                    
                    Note that an inactive connection still can be 
                    :ref:`pinged <web-admin-outgoing-soap-ping>`.
                    
Host                HTTP server's host, may include a port
URL path            If serialization type is string, path a service to be invoked is mounted on. If Suds, path a WSDL is under.
Data format         (Optional) Allows for automatic serialization of outgoing requests to XML if string-based serialization is used.
SOAP action         SOAP action a service to be invoked uses. Ignored if serialization type is Suds.
SOAP version        SOAP version a service to be invoked uses, can be either 1.1 or 1.2. Ignored if serialization type is Suds.
Ping method         HTTP method to use for pinging the connection (defaults to HEAD).
Pool size           How big an underlying connection pool can be, any requests above it will be discarded and a warning
                    will be logged. This setting is per each server worker and connections are created on demand, when they're actually
                    needed.
Timeout             Timeout, in seconds, after exceeding of which an exception will be raised without waiting for the external
                    resource to reply - use *zato.common.TimeoutException* to catch the exception if it's needed.
                    The value can be expressed in a fraction of a second, e.g. *0.5* to indicate half a second.
Serialization type  Whether requests will be prepared as strings by services or if `Suds <https://bitbucket.org/jurko/suds>`_
                    is used which lets one import WSDLs and serialize Python objects to SOAP automatically.
Security            Name of a security definition - 
                    :doc:`HTTP Basic Auth <../security/basic-auth>`
                    or
                    :doc:`SSL/TLS client cert<../security/tls/keys-certs>`
                    - to use for accessing the resource. 

                    If serialization type is Suds, NTLM can also be used.

                    Pick 'No security' explicitly to indicate that no such definition
                    should be used.
TLS CA certs        (Required if host starts with https://) Which :doc:`CA certs package <../security/tls/ca-certs>` to use for validating
                    the certificate of the external server. Use 'Skip validation' to explicitly configure the connection not
                    to validate the server certificate at all. Ignored if serialization type is Suds.

Ping
----

.. image:: /gfx/web-admin/outgoing/plain-http-soap-ping.png

A connection can be pinged - this sends an HTTP request (HEAD by default) from one of a 
cluster's servers to a location specified by the connection's definition. 
This can be used to check whether a given resource is reachable by Zato servers.

The feature is available even if a connection is inactive.

Reload WSDL
-----------

If an outgoing connection's serialization type is Suds, which implies automatic serialization of requests to SOAP
out of WSDLs, clicking on *Reload WSDL* refreshes the internal cache - otherwise any updates to the WSDL are not visible to any
connections using it.
