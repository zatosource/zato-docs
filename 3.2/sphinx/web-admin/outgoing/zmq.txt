Outgoing connections - ZeroMQ
=============================

Overview
--------

Used to create, update, delete and browse through outgoing ZeroMQ connections.

Each outgoing connection represents a link through which messages are sent 
to ZMQ sockets.

Creating or updating a connection (re-)establishes a link to a socket
and there are as many connectors and connections to a socket as there are 
active outgoing connections and :doc:`channels <../channels/zmq>` in a cluster.

For instance, if there are 5 outgoing connections using a socket, there will
be 5 connector processes started in a cluster each maintaining 1 connection
to the socket.

Sending messages to a ZMQ socket is an asynchronous activity - messages are not
rolled back to Zato services if there are any errors
along.

Stops the underlying connector and deletes the connection from ODB.

The 'Active' flag
-----------------

If an **outgoing connection** is made **inactive** and there are services still making
use of it, the **messages** services send **will be lost**. 

You need to ensure no service is able to reach an outgoing connection before
it's turned off - otherwise **you will lose messages**.

Also an inactive outgoing connection closes its underlying link to a queue manager
but the connector's process continues to run.
