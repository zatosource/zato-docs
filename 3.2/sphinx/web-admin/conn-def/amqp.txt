Connection definitions - AMQP
=============================

Overview
--------

Used to create, update, delete and browse
`AMQP 0.9.1 <http://www.rabbitmq.com/tutorials/amqp-concepts.html>`_
connection definitions.

A definition is a template off of which a concrete connection, either
:doc:`channel <../channels/amqp>`
or an
:doc:`outgoing one<../outgoing/amqp>`,
is created. Merely creating a definition doesn't start a connection to a broker.

One definition can serve to create multiple channels or outgoing connections.

and needs to be changed in order to be usable.

  It needs to be emphasized that any channels or outgoing
