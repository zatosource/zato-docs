Connection definitions - Cassandra
==================================

Overview
--------

Used to create, update, delete and browse 
`Cassandra <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apache_Cassandra>`_
connection definitions, including connections to `Datastax Enterprise <http://www.datastax.com/>`_.

A definition is a template for either preparing :doc:`precompiled CQL queries <../query/cassandra>`
or to issue ad-hoc CQL queries with.

* Menu path: Connections -> Definitions -> Cassandra
* Example address: http://localhost:8183/zato/definition/cassandra/?cluster=1

Updates a definition's password - the password is stored in the ODB.

Delete
------

.. image:: /gfx/web-admin/conn-def/cassandra-delete.png

Deletes a Cassandra definition and all the queries that make use of it.

.. note ::

  It needs to be emphasized that any :doc:`precompiled CQL queries <../query/cassandra>`
  that were using the definition will also be deleted automatically.
