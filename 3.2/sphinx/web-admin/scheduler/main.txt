Scheduler
=========

Overview
--------

* Menu path: Scheduler
* Example address: http://localhost:8183/zato/scheduler/?cluster=1

Manages scheduler-initiated background jobs. A background scheduler is always started
by one of the servers in a cluster. When a time arrives for a job to be invoked,
the scheduler publishes a message on a broker, the message is picked up
by one of the servers and a service is invoked.

Extra data is a string which Zato doesn't interfere with - it's provided as is
to a service in its request's :doc:`raw_request<../../progguide/reqresp/request>`
attribute.

A job is of a specific type:

============== ====================================================================
Type           Notes
============== ====================================================================
One-time       For one-off jobs, a job is run and then it's never scheduled again
Interval-based For recurring tasks, repeated indefinitely or until a specified time
Cron-style     Similar to interval-based one but uses
               `cron syntax <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cron>`_
