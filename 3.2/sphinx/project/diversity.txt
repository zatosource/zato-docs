Diversity statement
===================

Zato project and the community around it welcome and encourage participation by everyone.
Our community is based on mutual respect, tolerance, and encouragement, and we
are working to help each other live up to these principles.
We want our community to be more diverse: whoever you are, and whatever
your background, we welcome you.

Although we have phrased the formal diversity statement generically to make
it all-inclusive, we recognize that there are specific attributes that
are used to discriminate against people. In alphabetical order, some of these
attributes include (but are not limited to): age, culture, ethnicity, gender
identity or expression, national origin, physical or mental difference,
politics, race, religion, sex, sexual orientation, socio-economic status,
and subculture. We welcome people regardless of the values of these or
other attributes.

We encourage and offer tolerance and expect the same from you. Indeed, there will
be no tolerance for intolerance.

Note - this diversity statement was heavily inspired by 
`the Python's one <http://python.org/community/diversity/>`_.
