Creating users
===============

* Users can be created only by super-users but it is also possible for users to :doc:`sign up <./signup>` with the system
* The difference between creation and signing up is that the former lets the newly added user log in without any additional steps
  whereas :doc:`signup <./signup>` is a process with a few phases in its worfklow
* It is possible to create users using:

  * :doc:`REST API <./../../api/rest/user/create/>`
  * :doc:`Python API <./../../api/python/user/create/>`
  * :doc:`Command line <../../../admin/cli/sso>`
