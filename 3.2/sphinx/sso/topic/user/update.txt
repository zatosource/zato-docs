Updating users
==============

Users can update their own accounts and super-users are able to update any other person's accounts. This can be done
from either
:doc:`REST <../../api/rest/user/update>`
or
:doc:`Python <../../api/python/user/update>`
APIs.

Regular users may change the attributes below:

* email
* display_name
* first_name
* middle_name
* last_name

Super-admins may change all the data above, plus:

==================== ======== ===============================================================================================================

is_approved          bool     If an account's creation needs to be confirmed by super-admins, this flag dictates if a user is approved or not
is_locked            bool     If the account is locked or not - users cannot log into locked accounts
password_expiry      datatime When will the person's password expire - users cannot log into accounts with expired passwords
                              without changing them first
password_must_change bool     A flag that super-users may set in order to require another user to change his or her password the next
