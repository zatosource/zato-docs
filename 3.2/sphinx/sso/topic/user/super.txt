Super-users
===========

For the main part, a super-user is just like any other user, and all the information about
:doc:`regular users <./index>`
applies to super-users too.

The exceptions are that:

* There is no default REST endpoint to create super-users. They need to be created from command line or
  :doc:`Python API <../../api/python/user/create-super-user>`. Note that the Python API may be in turn mounted on a REST
  endpoint through an :doc:`HTTP channel <../../../web-admin/channels/plain-http>` but to prevent remote attacks, there is no default one.

* Only super-users can :doc:`create <./create>` other users - this is opposed to :doc:`signing up <./signup>`.
  The difference is that signup is a process which requires confirmation from the person that is about to become a user
  whereas the right to create users that super-users have means that users created become activated straight-away - they may
  still need to change their password, for instance, but there is no explicit confirmation step on their part.

* Regular users may manage information only about themselves but super-users can access data and metadata about other users too.
  Note that super-users cannot learn what any other user's password is, this is always secret.

* Certain API operations are available for super-users only, e.g. locking another user's account. Each relevant part of
  documentation states it whether super-user powers are required to carry out a given action.
