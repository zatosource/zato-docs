Request and response objects
============================

Overview
--------

:doc:`Request <./reqresp/request>`
and
:doc:`response <./reqresp/response>`
objects encapsulate information regarding the data a service
receives and produces. Both objects will always exist for each service invocation
but their payload can be empty, it is perfectly fine for a service not to accept
any input data nor to create output either.

Their respective chapters document how to work with requests and responses, including how to access or produce
protocol-specific metadata, such as HTTP or AMQP headers:

* Details of :doc:`requests <./reqresp/request>` objects
* Details of :doc:`response <./reqresp/response>` objects
