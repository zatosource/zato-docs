Visual Studio Code
------------------

To enable hot-deployment from Visual Studio Code, ensure you have first
followed the configuration instructions in :doc:`index`.

Configuration
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The `Zato for Visual Studio Code plug-in <https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=zatosource.ide-vscode>`_
available from the Visual Studio marketplace adds a default keybinding along
with a toolbar button enabling simplified hot-deployment to your development
cluster.

1. Visit the Extensions Marketplace either `in your browser <https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=zatosource.ide-vscode>`_, or within the application, by pressing *Ctrl+Shift+X* hot-key:

2. After installation completes, visit the settings panel *Ctrl+,* to configure your cluster connection:

Automatic deployment
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Automatic deployment is triggered on every file save if a Python file contains a special deployment marker
within its first 100 lines of source code:

::

    # zato: ide-deploy=True

For instance:

::

   # zato: ide-deploy=True

   from zato.server.service import Service

   class MyService(Service):
       def handle(self):
           pass

Manual deployment
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

While editing any Python module, you can deploy to the configured Zato cluster
by clicking the toolbar icon, or pressing the *Ctrl+Shift+L* hotkey:
