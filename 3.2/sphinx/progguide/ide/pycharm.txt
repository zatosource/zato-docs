PyCharm
-------

To enable hot-deployment from PyCharm and related IDEs, ensure you have first followed the configuration instructions
in :doc:`index`.

Supported products
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

* PyCharm and Professional
* IntelliJ Community and Ultimate with the Python plugin
* Minimal IDE version is 2016.3+

Configuration
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

As the Zato IDE hot-deployment plugin is published in the `JetBrains Plugin
Repository <https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/10375-zato-hot-deployment>`_,
installation on PyCharm is achieved directly from within the application.

1. Visit **Preferences -> Plugins**, then click **Browse repositories**:

Automatic deployment
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Automatic deployment is triggered on every file save if a Python file contains a special deployment marker
within its first 100 lines of source code:

::

    # zato: ide-deploy=True

For instance:

::

   # zato: ide-deploy=True

   from zato.server.service import Service

   class MyService(Service):
       def handle(self):
           pass

Manual deployment
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

With a Zato service open in an editor window, visit **Tools -> Upload to
default Zato server** to trigger upload manually:
