Hooking into a service’s lifecycle
==================================

While :ref:`handle <progguide-write-service-handle>` is the main method each
service needs to implement, hooks are methods of a service that can be optionally
overridden in order to  execute additional code before or after several
defined points in a service's lifecycle.

Which methods can be implemented depends on how a service is invoked - some
methods are common to all access mechanisms while the rest of them is specific
only to jobs executed through the scheduler.

Any exceptions raised in :ref:`before_add_to_store <progguide-write-service-before_add_to_store>`
will mean a service won't be deployed. For all other hooks, if an exception is raised,
it will be caught by Zato, logged, and the next method will be called as though there was
no exception in the previous one.

You can use the :ref:`environ <progguide-write-service-environ>` dictionary to pass
data down from a hook to another.

Common methods
--------------

These methods can be overridden regardless of the means a service will be executed
with, no matter its channel, if any, or if it's invoked through the
:doc:`scheduler <../../web-admin/scheduler/main>`
or not.

======================================================================== ===================================================================================
:ref:`before_add_to_store <progguide-write-service-before_add_to_store>` Static method that will be executed by each worker when a
                                                                         server starts up. A service will be deployed by that worker
                                                                         only if the method returns True and this is the value

:ref:`after_add_to_store <progguide-write-service-after_add_to_store>`   Static method that will be executed by each worker right after a
                                                                         service has been successfully deployed.

:ref:`accept <progguide-write-service-accept>`                           If False, the service won't be executed at all. Defaults to True.

:ref:`before_handle <progguide-write-service-before_handle>`             Executed right before a service's :ref:`handle <progguide-write-service-handle>`
                                                                         will be called

:ref:`after_handle <progguide-write-service-after_handle>`               Executed right after a service's :ref:`handle <progguide-write-service-handle>`
                                                                         has been called
:ref:`finalize_handle <progguide-write-service-finalize_handle>`         Executed after Zato has finished additional bookkeeping such as storing service
                                                                         statistics in :doc:`Redis </architecture/redis>` so that

Common and additional scheduler-specific methods
------------------------------------------------

A scheduler-initiated service can access all the
:ref:`common methods <progguide-service-hooks-common-methods>`
and a set of supplementary ones, and even then, some will depend on the job's type.
