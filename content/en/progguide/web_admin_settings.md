title: Making sure you work on the right environment
---

A single
[web admin \</architecture/web-admin\>]
instance can be used to handle multiple environments,
such as production, tests and development, and to help you with differentiating
which environment you currently work with, you can assign
(click [\'My settings\' \<../web-admin/settings/main\>] in the top-right corner) a color to each cluster
so that, for instance, a production cluster will be in yellow while development
will use green.

If you pick any, a horizontal bar of that color will be prominently displayed
to make sure you remember which environment you currently work with. Each web admin
user has their own set of colors.

``` {.python}
Note how choosing a color in user settings..
