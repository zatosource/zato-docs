title: Creating users
---

-   Users can be created only by super-users but it is also possible for users to [sign up \<./signup\>] with the system
-   The difference between creation and signing up is that the former lets the newly added user log in without any additional steps
    whereas [signup \<./signup\>] is a process with a few phases in its worfklow
-   It is possible to create users using:
    -   [REST API \<./../../api/rest/user/create/\>]
    -   [Python API \<./../../api/python/user/create/\>]
    -   [Command line \<../../../admin/cli/sso\>]
