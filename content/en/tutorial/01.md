title: Tutorial - part 1/2

Introduction
============

This tutorial will guide you through a process of creating a simple service that
will be integrated with 3 external applications over HTTP and Zero MQ using
JSON or XML as a data exchange format.

But what is a service?

To paraphrase the [programming guide](../progguide/overview),
a service is a piece of functionality that does something useful and interesting
to any party that would like to use it. It\'s like a function or a method but
running on a massively higher level - instead of exposing functions to other parts of
code in a single application, a service is exposed as an API to other systems.

Such an atomic and reusable building block as a service can be used to create any online
[middleware and backend](../intro/overview-high-level)
[application](../intro/overview-tech)
for any purpose.

Services can can
[invoke](../progguide/outconn/overview)
or
[accept connections](../progguide/channels)
through many
protocols and transports -[plain HTTP REST, SOAP, JSON](../progguide/outconn/http),
[AMQP](../progguide/outconn/amqp),
[IBM MQ\<../progguide/outconn/jms-wmq\>],
[ZeroMQ](../progguide/outconn/zmq),
[SQL](../progguide/outconn/sql),
[FTP(S)](../progguide/outconn/ftp)
[Cassandra CQL](../progguide/examples/cassandra),
[Amazon S3](../progguide/examples/cloud/aws/s3),
[OpenStack Swift](../progguide/examples/cloud/openstack/swift),
[Odoo/OpenERP](../progguide/examples/odoo)
[SMTP](../progguide/examples/smtp)
or
[IMAP](../progguide/examples/imap)

Integration patterns -[fan-out/fan-in](../progguide/patterns/fan-out-fan-in),
[parallel execution](../progguide/patterns/parallel-exec)
[invoke/retry](../progguide/patterns/invoke-retry),
and
[invoke with callbacks](../progguide/patterns/async-invoke)
let one form complex workflows running asynchronously.

There\'s also
[Redis key/value database](../progguide/kvdb)
and a built-in
[scheduler](../progguide/scheduler)
which is used for executing recurring tasks.

Services can also make use of
[HTTP Basic Auth](../web-admin/security/basic-auth),
[WS-Security](../web-admin/security/ws-security)
[API keys](../web-admin/security/apikey),
[AWS](../web-admin/security/aws),
[NTLM](../web-admin/security/ntlm),
[OAuth](../web-admin/security/oauth),
[SSL/TLS](../web-admin/security/tls/overview),
[XPath-based](../web-admin/security/xpath),
or
[RBAC (Role-Based Access Control)](../web-admin/security/rbac/overview)
security definitions.

And there are
[CLI](../admin/cli/index),
API
and a fabulous
[web admin](../web-admin/intro)
console for admins to use.

If you haven\'t done it yet, take a look at Zato\'s
[architecture](../architecture/overview)
to get an understanding of how all the various pieces play together.

Also note that **Zato is a middleware and backend server** as explained in the
[ESB/SOA introduction](../intro/esb-soa)
and in
[other](../intro/overview-high-level)
[chapters](../intro/overview-tech).

This means that it can be used to create applications, such as administration panels of backend systems
but typically it is used for APIs, systems of systems and microservices, not for frontend programming.

What will the tutorial achieve, exactly?
========================================

The service we\'ll create will be:

-   Accepting input in JSON or XML through HTTP
-   Invoking HTTP JSON services of 2 systems
-   Optionally notifying a 3rd system using JSON over Zero MQ
-   Fetching business rules from Redis

After finishing the tutorial you\'ll also have a good understanding of key
Zato features, such as
[CLI](../admin/cli/index),
[web admin](../web-admin/intro),
[hot-deployment](../admin/guide/installing-services),
[statistics](../stats/guide)
and several more.

This all will be only a tip of the iceberg but still should give you a thorough
introduction to Zato.

The message flow {#tutorial-01-message-flow}
================

![image](/gfx/tutorial/service-complete.png)

We\'ll be building part of what could be a beginning of a bank application.

-   A client applications wishes to learn a couple of things about a customer given their CUST_ID.
    The data it expects is:
    -   Customer\'s first and last name
    -   Last time the client made a payment
    -   The payment amount
-   Customer data is stored in a [CRM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consumer_relationship_system)
-   Payments are stored in a different application
-   For certain customer types, there\'s a business requirement that a fraud detection
    system be notified of any operations regarding such customers, so our service
    needs to comply with it even though it\'s merely reading customer-related data,
    it doesn\'t really transfer money between accounts.

Note that in the diagram above both the service and Redis are of the same color,
this is because they both are part of the same Zato
[cluster](../architecture/overview)
while the other parties don\'t be belong to Zato.

The Client App is something we won\'t cover - this is where Django, RoR, .NET forms,
Groovy, PHP and many other frontend technologies come into play - a Client App can
be simply anything that can invoke a Zato service and in this tutorial the Client App
will be simulated by
[curl](http://curl.haxx.se/).

Installing Zato and creating a quickstart cluster
=================================================

As a prerequisite - you need access to [Redis 2.8.4+](http://redis.io) - this is an external component
which is not shipped with Zato and needs to be installed separately. So first, install Redis and start it.

Now you can install Zato itself - there are package repositories prepared for:

-   [RHEL/CentOS](../admin/guide/install/rhel)
-   [Ubuntu](../admin/guide/install/ubuntu)
-   [Debian](../admin/guide/install/debian)

Windows and OS X users are recommended to install
[Ubuntu 16.04 LTS](http://ubuntu.com)
under
[VirtualBox](https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads)
and proceed to
[installation instructions](../admin/guide/install/ubuntu)
for Ubuntu.

You can install Zato [under Docker](../admin/guide/install/docker) this will install everything
including a sample quickstart cluster.

Done yet? OK, so if you are not using Docker, let\'s create a quickstart cluster, which is a sort of a cluster
created by running the
[CLI commands](../../admin/cli/index),
appropriately called
[zato quickstart create](../../admin/cli/quickstart-create).

You need to prepare:

-   As user zato, an empty directory (\$path), such as \~/env/qs-1
-   Host, port and a password for connecting to Redis (\$kvdb_host, \$kvdb_port and \$kvdb_password)

Note that user user zato created during installation does not have any default password. It means that you need either to
execute \'sudo su - zato\' or \'su - zato\' to switch to that user or change the zato user\'s password first as root or another
account with elevated privileges.

Now run the following command as user zato, substituting placeholders with the information
you\'ve prepared. You\'ll be asked for passwords and they won\'t be echoed.

In the command below, observe that the Redis password can be empty - indeed, if you\'ve just installed Redis without
configuring anything, it must be empty because by default Redis doesn\'t require it.

```
$ zato quickstart create $path sqlite $kvdb_host $kvdb_port \
  --kvdb_password $kvdb_password --verbose
```

For instance:

``` {.text emphasize-lines="14"}
$ zato quickstart create ~/env/qs-1 sqlite localhost 6379 \
  --kvdb_password '' --verbose

[1/8] Certificate authority created
[2/8] ODB schema created
[3/8] ODB initial data created
[4/8] server1 created
[5/8] server2 created
[6/8] Load-balancer created
Superuser created successfully.
[7/8] Web admin created
[8/8] Management scripts created
Quickstart cluster quickstart-962637 created
Web admin user:[admin], password:[Fc8-43IRUVeyWVgKtUR8YqXJSQriJt6x]
Start the cluster by issuing the /opt/zato/env/qs-1/zato-qs-start.sh command
Visit https://zato.io/support for more information and support options
$
```

Note the highlighted line - these are credentials you\'ll need to log into a
[web admin\'s instance](../web-admin/intro)
just created. In case you feel the
[randomly generated password](https://github.com/zatosource/zato/blob/support/2.0/code/zato-common/src/zato/common/markov_passwords.py),
even a human-readable one, should still be changed, you can do it using the
[zato update password](../../admin/cli/update-password)
command.

What was created by invoking zato quickstart create:

-   A development CA
-   2 servers
-   An HA load-balancer in front of the two
-   A web-admin panel instance and an admin user
-   ODB structure in SQLite and Redis
-   Scripts to (re-)start the environment and stop it

The whole of it uses randomly generated crypto material (keys and certificates),
and is automatically configured so that all the parts are aware of each other,
e.g. the load balancer knows what servers to route the traffic to, the web admin
understands where all the components to manage are and so on.

In short, the command has just created a complete environment.

Important TCP ports that will be used are:

  Port                              Notes
  --------------------------------- -------------------------------------------------------------------------
  [11223](http://localhost:11223)   Load-balancer\'s HTTP port
                                    (this is what external applications use to invoke services you develop)
  [17010](http://localhost:17010)   server1\'s HTTP port
  [17011](http://localhost:17011)   server2\'s HTTP port
  [8183](http://localhost:8183)     Web admin\'s HTTP port (this is where you point your browser to and log
                                    in as an admin user)

![image](/gfx/tutorial/quickstart-ports.png)

The load-balancer and servers can all run on different hosts, but to keep focused
on basic things first, the tutorial uses a quickstart cluster which installs everything
on localhost.

And although this is a tutorial only, this can be a good approach to easily
create any serious Zato environment later on. Just create a quickstart
cluster, rename it to \'dev1\' or similarly and start
[adding and configuring](../../admin/guide/install-config/overview)
as many servers as you need.

Invoking services with cURL
===========================

```
$ zato check-config $path/server1
SQL ODB connection OK
Redis connection OK
$
```

```
$ zato check-config $path/server2
SQL ODB connection OK
Redis connection OK
$

If there's no output as shown above, the
./zato-qs-start.sh command below will not succeed and if you continue you'll hit upon
issues in later steps so you'll be scratching your head trying to figure out
what went wrong.

**Again, please make sure Redis will allow Zato to establish connections.**
```

First off, let\'s start the thing we\'ve just brought to this world:

```
$ ./zato-qs-start.sh
Starting the Zato quickstart environment
Running sanity checks
[1/6] Redis connection OK
[2/6] SQL ODB connection OK
[3/6] Load-balancer started
[4/6] server1 started
[5/6] server2 started
[6/6] Web admin started
Zato quickstart environment started
Visit https://zato.io/support for more information and support options
$
```

Zato comes with several goodies meant to ease with development and one of them
is the zato.ping service which is automatically mounted on /zato/ping so it
can be invoked through the load-balancer using curl (output below is slightly reformatted for clarity).

```
$ curl localhost:11223/zato/ping ; echo
{
  "zato_env": {"details": "", "result": "ZATO_OK", "cid": "K06KKS03EESNYYPHBWE74ZEJ4X56"},
  "zato_ping_response": {"pong": "zato"}
}
$
```

The response produced by zato.ping happens to be a JSON document.

-   We can see there were no errors encountered (ZATO_OK)
-   The [correlation ID](progguide-write-service-cid) (cid) serves as an
    identifier which can be used to reconcile information regarding the fate of a service\'s
    invocation across multiple systems

Hot-deploying your first service
================================

Fire up your favorite programming editor and let\'s finally create our own Zato service.

Save the following code as my_service.py

``` {.python}
from zato.server.service import Service

class GetClientDetails(Service):
    def handle(self):
        self.log_input()
```

-   Each
    [service](../progguide/service-dev)
    always subclasses zato.server.service.Service
-   [handle(self)](progguide-write-service-handle)
    is the only method that a service must implement,
    this is where the actual action takes place, this is the heart of a service
-   [log_input](progguide-write-service-log_input)
    is one of the helper methods a service has access to. As you can imagine,
    this one dumps all the input data into server logs.

Code saved? Good, now we can hot-deploy it.

The story is, there are
[several ways](../../admin/guide/installing-services)
to make code available to Zato and hot-deployment is one of them.

Either through command line or using the web admin, you can push services to one
of the servers in a cluster and it will be picked up automatically by all the nodes
without any restarts. This includes updates to services that already exist.

To hot-deploy a service from command line you need to copy the Python module
it\'s in into a pick-up directory.

In the tutorial you can use either \$path/server1/pickup/incoming/services or
\$path/server2/pickup/incoming/services, it doesn\'t matter which one you\'ll choose as the other
server will instantly synchronize its state with the one that will receive the service.

So, choosing \$path/server1/pickup/incoming/services, copy the module:

```
$ cp my_service.py $path/server1/pickup/incoming/services
```

Now, in each server log - ./logs/server.log - there will be as many confirmations
of a successful deployment as there are worker processes running in your cluster.

``` {.python}
INFO - zato.hot-deploy.create:33 - Uploaded package id:[1], payload_name:[my_service.py]
```

Our service is there but we can\'t reach it from the client application yet because
it\'s not exposed through any
[channels](../../progguide/channels) - a single service can be used over
many independent channels, each using different security configuration, transport
protocols, data format etc.

You need to explicitly tell Zato how to make a given service available to all
and each of external systems interested in invoking it. You do it in the
web admin so let\'s visit <http://localhost:8183/> with a browser now.

Log in using the credentials you surely noted down a couple of steps above
or [update](../../admin/cli/update-password) the admin\'s password
if you can\'t access it anymore.

![image](/gfx/tutorial/web-admin-login.png)

From the main menu pick *Services*, choose your cluster, type *get-client* in the
search box and click *Show services*.

![image](/gfx/tutorial/web-admin-search.png){width="95.0%"}

This confirms that the service indeed exists on the cluster even though it\'s
still not possible to access it from the outside.

A question may arise, how come the service is called my-service.get-client-details?
It\'s because Zato uncamelifies strings such as MyFancyName or PrepareCustomerDocuments
into my-fancy-name or prepare-customer-documents to make them more Pythonic.
Naturally, this can be [overridden](progguide-write-service-get_name).

Exposing a service over HTTP and invoking it
============================================

OK, the service is deployed so why don\'t we make it possible for others to invoke it.

Still in the web admin, navigate to Connections -\> Channels -\> Plain HTTP

![image](/gfx/tutorial/web-admin-channels.png){width="95.0%"}

![image](/gfx/tutorial/web-admin-channels-new.png)

Some of the fields may not be self-explanatory so there is, of course,
[a chapter](../web-admin/channels/plain-http)
in the
[web admin guide](../web-admin/intro)
where it\'s all detailed.

Note that in order to emphasize the point that a service\'s name is decoupled
from names of any channels that may be using it or from an HTTP path it\'s mounted
under, those values are all different in the tutorial.

![image](/gfx/tutorial/web-admin-channels-new-success.png)

And that\'s it. The channel has been created, all servers have been notified of
its having been formed so they automatically hot-updated their HTTP configuration and we can
now use curl again to invoke our creation.

```
$ curl localhost:11223/tutorial/first-service
$
```

This doesn\'t produce any output because the service returns none, it\'s only
logging its input data to server logs so this is where we need to look for
a palpable proof that a service was indeed invoked.

Note that the request went through a load-balancer and because we use local
files instead of logging to syslog, we can\'t be sure which server\'s logs to check
hence you need to grep in both of them and look for an entry similar to the one below
(reformatted a bit for clarity)

``` {.python}

And that concludes the first part! You\'ve created a cluster, a service, hot-deployed it
and then invoked it successfully. The [next part](./02) will focus much
more on the business functionality now that the general framework to work within has
been laid down.

[Continue on to part 2/2](./02)
