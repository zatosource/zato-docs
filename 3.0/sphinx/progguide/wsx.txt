WebSocket connections
=====================

WebSocket channels created in :doc:`web-admin <../web-admin/channels/wsx>` are programming language-agnostic, which means that
they may be used to invoke services and publish or receive :doc:`publish/subscribe <../pubsub/index>` messages
from any application that speaks WebSockets and JSON, e.g. Python, JavaScript or any other.

To utilize the channels, applications (API clients) need to follow a protocol described in this chapter.

* Upon opening an initial TCP stream, the client needs to obtain a token within a certain time (by default, 5 seconds)
* Token returned by Zato identifies uniquely this particular client connection down to its TCP socket
* The token is a random string considered a secret and must not be shared with any other client or connection
* No other client is allowed to re-use an already issued token and each connection has exactly one token throughout its existence
* Although the token is a strong random string, it can be used only for client identification and it must not be
  used on client side for any cryptographical purposes (there are dedicated :doc:`crypto <./crypto/index>` APIs in Zato
  for such needs)
* Each token has a TTL, a Time To Live, which defaults to 864000 seconds = 10 days. Each time the channel is invoked the token's
  TTL is extended by that many seconds from current time. If token reaches its TTL, any subsequent invocation will be rejected
  and the TCP socket will be closed.
* Clients must send WebSocket Ping frames (per `RFC-6455 <https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6455#section-5.5.2>`_) at least
  once in 30 seconds. If 5 consecutive pings from a client are missed, the connection is dropped by Zato.
* Ping frames must not send business data, they are used only for keeping connections alive
* Applications may both invoke API services as as well take part in :doc:`publish/subscribe <../pubsub/index>`
  workflows - in the latter case they can act as publishers, subscribers, or both

Connecting, and obtaining a session token
-----------------------------------------

Clients establish an initial WebSocket connection to the address a given channel utilizes, possibly taking into
account the fact that there may be a load-balancer performing URL transformations or port mappings in front of Zato servers.

Once a connection is created, clients need to create a session and receive a session token. This step needs to be done
even if for a given WebSocket channel no client credentials are needed.

Clients must use the session token in all requests over the same TCP connection. The token cannot be used any other
connections, it is specific to one TCP stream.

Right after a TCP connection is established, before logging in, an information entry is stored in server logs. This includes
data about from what IP address and domain name the connection comes from as well as the address and name of the WebSocket
channel.

::

  INFO - New connection from 127.0.0.1:51738 (localhost) to 127.0.0.1:48902 (my.wsx.channel)


If a client connects but does not initiate the create-session request within the expected time, the TCP connection will be
closed with an accompanying warning message in server logs:

::

  WARNING - Peer 127.0.0.1:51738 (localhost) did not create session within 5s,
  closing its connection to 127.0.0.1:48902 (my.wsx.channel), cid:`23b3cae088382f62106edd67`

Otherwise, if the client creates a session successfully, an informational message will be saved to logs:

::

  INFO - Client 127.0.0.1:57288 (localhost ws.eee4b49d6fd835b424175ed5)
  logged in successfully to 127.0.0.1:48902 (my.wsx.channel)

Request

================ ======== ======== ==================================================================================
Element          Datatype Optional Notes
================ ======== ======== ==================================================================================
meta             dict     ---      A dictionary of metadata for the request
meta.action      string   ---      A constant value of "create-session"
meta.username    string   Yes      Username to authenticate with (if needed)
meta.secret      string   Yes      Password or other channel-specific secret to authenticate with (if needed)
meta.id          string   ---      Client-generated request ID - must be globally unique (e.g. UUID4). Returned in
                                   responses in the in_reply_to element to let clients know in reply to which
                                   request a given response is returned.
meta.timestamp   datetime ---      When the message was generated by client, must be in UTC using ISO-8601
                                   YYYY-MM-DDTHH:mm:ss.ssssss
meta.client_id   string   ---      An arbitrary business ID of the client - any value identifying the client can
                                   be used, e.g. ID of a business application such as crm.prod.1 or ID of an IoT
                                   device connecting to Zato such as printer.mx2.3910
meta.client_name string   Yes      Human-friendly identifier of the client (in addition to client_id)

                                 an element with the session token.
data.token     string   Yes      A randomly generated session token - returned only if
