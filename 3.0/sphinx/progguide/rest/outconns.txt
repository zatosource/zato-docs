REST outgoing connections
=========================

:doc:`Plain HTTP outgoing connections <../../web-admin/outgoing/plain-http>` allow one to invoke REST-based endpoints and:

* URL paths can include patterns
* Query string parameters are built from user-provided dictionaries
* Payload can be automatically serialized to JSON or XML
* Services can produce any and all headers the endpoint expects

Suppose there's a POST REST endpoint at http://example.com which expects:

* A URL path in the format of */customer/{cust_id}/phone_no/{phone_no}*
* Query string *?priority=normal*
* JSON payload *{"billing":"395.7", "currency":"EUR"}*
* Custom HTTP headers, *X-App-Name: Zato* and *X-Environment: Production*

An outgoing connection and a service using it would read as follows:

        from __future__ import absolute_import, division, print_function, unicode_literals

        # Zato
        from zato.server.service import Service

        class SetBillingInfo(Service):
            """ Updates a customer's billing information.
            """
            def handle(self):

                # Python dict representing the payload we want to send across
                payload = {'billing':'395.7', 'currency':'EUR'}

                # Python dict with all the query parameters, including path and query string
                params = {'cust_id':'39175', 'phone_no':'271637517', 'priority':'normal'}

                # Headers the endpoint expects
                headers = {'X-App-Name': 'Zato', 'X-Environment':'Production'}

                # Obtains a connection object
                conn = self.outgoing.plain_http['SetBillingInfo'].conn

                # Invoke the resource providing all the information on input
                response = conn.post(self.cid, payload, params, headers=headers)

Notes:

* As a programmer you never need to leave Python land, (de-)serialization is automatic and one can work with Python dictionaries only

* The response object offers :doc:`access <../reqresp/index>` to the whole of the body, headers and other metadata the endpoint returns

* Most of the code presented will work with both JSON and XML but for JSON endpoints in particular, accessing  them can be further
  simplified using the dedicated :doc:`JSON adapter <json-adapter>`
