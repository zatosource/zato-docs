OpenStack Swift
===============

Once
:doc:`an OpenStack Swift connection <../../../../web-admin/cloud/openstack/swift>`
has been created it is possible to execute any and all calls the underlying Python
library offers.

.. _progguide-examples-cloud-openstack-swift-store:

Storing data in containers
--------------------------

::

            from zato.server.service import Service

            class MyService(Service):
                def handle(self):
                    with self.cloud.openstack.swift.get('My Connection').conn.client() as client:

                        # What to store and where
                        container = 'test123'
                        object_name = 'my-document.txt'
                        contents = 'Hi there'

                        # Now store it
                        client.put_object(container, object_name, contents)

Accessing the underlying library
--------------------------------

Connections to to Swift are built using the OpenStack's
`swiftclient <http://docs.openstack.org/developer/python-swiftclient/swiftclient.html>`_ library whose
swiftclient.client.Connection objects are what the *client* actually is.

The client offers means to access full Swift API for reading, deleting and other operations on Swift objects -
consult the
`client's documentation <http://docs.openstack.org/developer/python-swiftclient/swiftclient.html>`_
for usage details.

::

            from zato.server.service import Service

            class MyService(Service):
                def handle(self):
                    with self.cloud.openstack.swift.get('My Connection').conn.client() as client:

                        # The actual connection's implementation
                        self.logger.info(client)
