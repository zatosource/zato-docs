Pub/sub - endpoints - Flat files
================================

Overview
--------

Each Zato server is equipped with file listeners that are notified of changes to user-defined directories. It is possible
to configure the listeners so as to publish information about new files, including their contents, as they appear in directories
of choice.

An example workflow is:

* Configure :doc:`scheduler <../../../web-admin/scheduler/main>` to periodically execute a service
* The service saves to local directories files downloaded from remote resources,
  e.g. using :doc:`FTP connections <../../../web-admin/outgoing/ftp>`
* Listeners automatically recognize that a new file appeared in a directory and publish its contents to one or more topics
* Topic subscribers can be REST, AMQP, WebSockets or Java JMS endpoints and all of them receive the file in question

Configuration
-------------

File transfer is managed through configuration files in each server's *config/repo/pickup.conf* file. For instance, if a given
server is installed in /opt/zato/env/prod/server1 the full path will be /opt/zato/env/prod/server1/config/repo/pickup.conf.

The file is in INI format. Each stanza deals with files to be picked up and published from a single directory, as below.
The configuration can be potentially different for each server in cluster. After changes to the file, the server this
file belongs to needs to be restarted.

Key                  Notes
==================== =============================================================================
pickup_from          The directory to listen for file changes in. May be an absolute path
                     or relative to the directory where the server is installed.
move_processed_to    The directory to move files to after they are published. Same as above
                     with regards to absolute or relative paths.
patterns             A comma-separated list of file patterns to take into account. Files whose
                     names do not match any of patterns will be ignored.
read_on_pickup       If True (default), the contents of the file will be published along with
                     metadata. If False, only metadata, such as file name, will be published.
delete_after_pickup  If True (default), the file will be deleted from the *pickup_from*
                     directory after the publication
topics               A comma-separate list of topics to publish the matching files to
