Publish/subscribe architecture
==============================

High-level overview
-------------------

.. image:: /gfx/pubsub/intro.png

Publish/subscribe features are a built-in part of Zato that that lets one use it as a message broker in addition to
:doc:`SOA/API services <../../intro/esb-soa>` or :doc:`SSO and user management APIs <../../sso/index>`.

Business data can be exchanged between applications using a notion of topics and delivery queues. Publishers produce messages
that are routed by Zato to subscribers, applying transformation or security rules while flowing through the platform.

Each application exchanging information using publish/subscribe may use a different connection protocol and different
security mechanism without influencing each other.

There is built-in support for Python, REST, SOAP, WebSockets, Java JMS or flat (batch) files and each can be used independently,
thus a Zato-based publish/subscribe environment can support diverse integration needs from large CRM or ERP systems,
through online APIs to IoT devices.

Applications participating in the exchange of messages using topics and message queues are collectively known as
endpoints. Each endpoint encapsulates information about which application connects to pub/sub as well as the endpoint's
access permissions - which topics it can publish and subscribe to.

Each endpoint has a role - publisher, subscriber or publisher/subscriber. In addition to it, each endpoint can be configured
to have access for publication or subscription only to topics matching user-defined patterns.

For each subscriber and each topic, a message queue is maintained automatically by Zato to keep data in until the subscriber
confirms it has received a particular message.

A delivery queue can be in-RAM or backed by persistent storage. Both types of queues will buffer messages if the subscriber is
not available. Additionally, the latter case is called a Guaranted Delivery (GD) queue because its contents will be available even
if all Zato servers go down which is not the case with in-RAM queues.

In-RAM queues are limited by the amount of RAM available for Zato servers. GD queues store their data in an SQL database and are
limited by the disk space assigned to the database.

GD queues will survive a full restart of all Zato servers in a given environment because all of their data is kept in an
SQL database. Conversely, in-RAM queues have no persistent storage so restarting servers will mean all their messages will
be lost.

Messages that are in transit can be modified in place - for instance, if a subscriber keeps rejecting a message it is possible
to update it without requiring the publisher to re-publish it because it may be at times impossible.

Subscriptions may be explicitly created by administrators or, if allowed to, applications may subscribe through dedicated
API calls.

A web-admin console offers access to all the configuration as well as means to browse the contents of queues
along with commonly needed metadata such as when a topic was last published to.

A detailed audit log lets administrators understand when each message was published and delivered.

Topics
------

Each topic has a unique name that identifies the topic and its business purpose among other topics. For instance, in the
screenshot above topic 'customer.new.1' may be used to publish data about new customers added to a company's CRM
with subscribers interested in receiving this business event.

A topic can be active or inactive. An active topic can be used for message publication whereas an inactive one will reject
any new messages.

Each topic can be GD enabled or not. If it is, each published message will be by default covered by guaranteed delivery
though this setting can be overridden on a per-message basis.

API subscriptions may be enabled or disabled for topic - in the former case applications holding correct credentials and
access permissions will be allowed to subscribe to topics using APIs such as REST. In the former case, only administrators
will be able to create subscriptions.

A topic has its maximum depth, which is maintained separately for in-RAM and GD messages. If there are no subscribers for a topic
and messages keep arriving, at one point the topic's depth will be reached and new messages published will be rejected
until the previous messages will have been consumed by subscribers or the topic has been cleared by administrators.

Endpoints
---------

.. image:: /gfx/pubsub/arch/endpoint-create.png

Endpoints - publishers and subscribers - typically represent a single application taking part in publish/subscribe-based
processes and their names reflect it.

An endpoint has its type which represents the underlying technology and protocol. Supported types are REST, SOAP, Zato services,
Java JMS and WebSockets.

Endpoints are assigned a role that broadly allows them to publish to topics, subscribe to topics, or both, no matter which
ones in particular, e.g. if an endpoint is a publisher only then it will never be able to subscribe to any topic,
it will be able to send but not to receive messages.

Pattern-based permissions dictate what topics an endpoint can publish or subscribe to. For instance, in the screenshot
above, endpoint ERP will be able to publish messages to topic 'customer.new.daily', if such a topic exists, because it matches
pattern 'customer.new.*' but it won't be able to publish to topic 'customer.updates.hourly' because there is no corresponding
access pattern.

Subscriptions
-------------

.. image:: /gfx/pubsub/arch/subscription-create.png

Provided that there are correct permission patterns and that relevant topics exist, each endpoint may subscribe to one
or more topics.

Delivery of messages for each subscription is always carried out by a single server, called a delivery server for that
subscription. This ensures correct message ordering - if there are multiple servers in a Zato cluster each receiving messages
ultimately destined for the subscription, they will be forwarded to that subscription's delivery server first.
For in-RAM messages, they are kept in the delivery server's RAM.

Messages can be sent on a notify or pull basis. The former means that Zato itself will be invoking the endpoint with new messages
whereas pull means that Zato will queue messages up and the recipient itself will periodically read the contents of its queue.
Regardless of the delivery type, messages can be sent one-by-one or in batches of a pre-configured size.

Delivery of a message can be repeated up to a configured number of times, with a sleep time in between them, configurable
depending on what kind of error was encountered - a TCP socket-level one or a different one.

For each type of an endpoint, this endpoint type's specific options can be provided - for instance, the endpoint in the screenshot
above is a REST one so an HTTP method can be specified that should be used to deliver messages with.

Each endpoint may subscribe to topics multiple types and each time it is given a new subscription key - this is a secret that
must be known only to the participant to whom it was issued.

GUI

  :width: 100%

Administrators have access to a GUI through Zato's built-in web admin console - it offers all the features needed for
configuration and maintenance, including ability to configure topics, endpoints, subscriptions, browse messages,
publish new data or update existing messages in place.

Security
--------

Integrity and security of publish/subscribe topics are guarded on several levels.

* Each application needs to be authenticated using its protocol-specific mechanism. For instance, REST ones will send an API key.
* Ability to publish or subscribe to topics needs to be explicitly - by default an endpoint does not have any permissions
  to any of topics
* Credentials are always stored in the database in an encrypted form (AES-128, CBC, PKCS7)
* As is the case with other parts of Zato, there are no default passwords anywhere

Persistent storage
------------------

Zato uses an SQL database for persistent storage of guaranteed delivery queues. This is the same database that the platform's
other tables are kept in. Standard SQL tools and facilities may be used to backup and move publish/subscribe data if needed.

Expired messages are periodically cleaned up by background jobs - the configuration is kept in the
:doc:`server.conf <../../admin/guide/install-config/config-server>`
file. By default, such messages are removed from their relevant tables after 10 seconds, but, since they are already
expired, they will never be delivered to any endpoint no matter how often the background cleanup tasks run.

Logging
-------

For each message published a new entry is stored in the audit log. By default, this information is saved to log files
but it can be reconfigured to send entries to other destinations such as syslog or Sentry.

Each entry contains full metadata about the message, for instance, which endpoint published it, based on what security pattern
access was granted, when the message will expire or what its priority was.
