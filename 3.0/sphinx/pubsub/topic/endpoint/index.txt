Publish/subscribe endpoints
===========================

Preliminary reading: :doc:`Pub/sub architecture <../../arch/index>`.

Introduction
------------

Endpoints are the entities that send messages to topics or receive them from queues. In a typical architecture,
a single endpoint will represent a particular application participating in pub/sub processes but there is no requirement
that there be only one endpoint per application and users are free to create as many endpoints as necessary.

In Zato 3.0, there are several types of endpoints:

* REST
* SOAP
* WebSockets
* Zato services
* Flat files

REST, SOAP and WebSockets need to be :doc:`registered <>` by administrators before they can take part in publish/subscribe.
Endpoints of this kind can be configured to let them publish messages, subscribe to them or both.

Zato services do not need to be managed by administrators because they can always :doc:`publish or subscribe <>`
to all topics.

Flat files are used to :doc:`listen for changes <>` in directories of choice, i.e. they are file listeners that publish information
to topics about new or changed files, optionally including their contents. File listeners can publish messages to topics
but they cannot subscribe to them.

Managing endpoints in web-admin
-------------------------------

Each endpoint defined in web-admin has a type, name and role. Each is identified by its name which is unique among all other
endpoints no matter which type they are of.

For REST and SOAP endpoints, API credentials, such as HTTP Basic Auth ones, must be assigned to them.
Applications connecting to Zato topics and queues will in run-time use the credentials for authentication.

WebSockets-based endpoints must point to a WebSockets channel which will in turn optionally specify a security definition
to be used for authentication.

A role of Publisher, Subscriber or Publisher/Subscriber may be assigned to each endpoint. This dictates if an endpoint may,
in principle, publish or subscribe to topics.

Access to topics is based on patterns, that is, a single access pattern may cover multiple topics, possibly including ones
that do not exist at the time of an endpoint's creation.

It is customary to arrange topic names and their respective permission patterns in hierarchical structures, going from
the broadest elements to the more specific ones using a slash */* for the separator, akin to file paths in a filesystem.

Special symbol that can be used in patterns are:

====== ============= =====================================================
Symbol Name          Notes
====== ============= =====================================================
\*     Asterisk      Matches zero or more characters, excluding the slash
\*\*   Two asterisks Matches zero or more characters, including the slash
====== ============= =====================================================

Supposing there are several topics:

=========================== =========================================================================
Topic                       Notes
=========================== =========================================================================
/usa/va/richmond            Events related to Richmond, Virginia, USA
/usa/va/washington          Events related to Washington, Virginia, USA
/customer/address/changed   Notifications about changed addresses of customers in a company's CRM
/customer/telephone/changed Notifications about changed telephones of customers in a company's CRM
/customer/telephone/deleted Notifications about deleted telephones of customers in a company's CRM
=========================== =========================================================================

It is possible to create various access patterns depending on the intended purpose.

===================== ==================================================================================
Pattern               Notes
===================== ==================================================================================
/usa/va/richmond      Because it does not use special symbols, this matches that exact topic name
/usa/**               Matches any topics related to the USA, i.e. any that start with this prefix
/usa/va/*             Matches any topics related to Virginia, USA. Currently, it would match Richmond
                      and Washington but should another topic be added, such as /usa/va/arlington,
                      it will be also matched in run-time even if this topic does not exist at the time
                      when the endpoint was created or last edited.
/usa/*/richmond       Matches any Richmond city in the USA
/customer/**          Matches all topics related to customers in the CRM
/customer/*/changed   Matches all topics related to changes in customers
/customer/telephone/* Matches all topics related to changes or deletions in customers
===================== ==================================================================================

Note that patterns are specified separately for publications and subscriptions and that there must be a matching
role for the pattern to be taken into account at all, i.e. if an endpoint has publication rights to a topic
but its role is a Subscriber then it will not be able to publish the message despite correct access rights. This can be used
to temporarily revoke publication or subscription rights without a need to redefine permissions.

In the example below, a REST endpoint called CRM is of a Publisher/Subscriber role. It uses credentials defined in a HTTP Basic
Auth security 'pubapi'. It is allowed to publish to all topics matching pattern */usa/va/\** but it is not allowed to subscribe
to messages from these topics. It is, however, allowed to both publish and subscribe to messages matching pattern
*/customer/\*/changed*.
