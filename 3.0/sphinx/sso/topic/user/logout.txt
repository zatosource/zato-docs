Logging out
===========

* Once :doc:`logged in <./login>`, each user is given a UST - user session token, which uniquely identifies each session,
  similarly to how cookies identify HTTP-based sessions in web applications

* To log a user out, invoke either a
  :doc:`REST <../../api/rest/user/logout>`
  or
  :doc:`Python <../../api/python/user/logout>`
  API providing the UST on input

* The logout action makes the user logged out of all applications - it is not possible to log out from a single application only
