Deleting users
==============

A logged in super-user can delete other users using
:doc:`REST <../../api/rest/user/delete>`,
:doc:`Python <../../api/python/user/delete>`
or from
:doc:`command line <../../../admin/cli/sso-delete-user>`. Regular users cannot delete any kind of users.

It is not possible even for super-users to delete their own accounts, i.e. super-users need to be deleted
either by other super-users or using a CLI command.

Deletion is irrevocable - there is no undo and all data about the user, related session or attributes is deleted.
