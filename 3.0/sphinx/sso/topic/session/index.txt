Sessions
========

Sessions represent users that are logged in to the system. Each session may have a number of
arbitrary :doc:`attributes <./attr/index>` associated that are stored in the database for as long as the session exists.
There is no limit to how many sessions a single user may have active at a time.

Each session is identified by a UST - user session token. A UST is a random string uniquely assigned to each session.
It is a secret that must never be revealed to other users or outside parties. It is akin to cookies in HTTP-based web applications.

* How to :doc:`log a user out <../user/logout>`
