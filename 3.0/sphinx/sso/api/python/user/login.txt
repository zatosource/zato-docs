User.login - Python API
=======================

Logs a user into the system. On success, returns session info, including a UST (user session token) that represents
a particular session of that user with the SSO environment.

On invalid input raises zato.sso.api.ValidationError which contains details in the form of
:doc:`status and sub-status codes <../../../status-code>`
pointing to specific erroneous conditions.

Note that only users whose approval_status is "approved" will be able to log in, otherwise an error will be raised.

  :param has_remote_addr: Should be set to True if input remote_addr was sent explicitly by user in JSON or to False if
                          it was extracted by the caller (e.g. from the WSGI environment)
  :type has_remote_addr: bool

  :param has_user_agent: Should be set to True if input user_agent was sent explicitly by user in JSON or to False if
                          it was extracted by the caller (e.g. from the WSGI environment)
