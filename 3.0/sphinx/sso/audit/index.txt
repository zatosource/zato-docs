Audit log
=========

Overview
--------

To help track access to PII
(`Personally identifiable information <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Personally_identifiable_information>`_),
Zato SSO makes use of an audit log.

Each action carried out against the SSO system results in an entry added to an audit log, with each message describing the
operation and its related metadata. This functionality is always on and cannot be disabled. User-defined services may also
store their own log entries using the Python API documented below.

        "op": "signup", "extra": {"current_app": "CRM", "remote_addr": "127.0.0.1"}}

Each log record captures the following information:

============ ======== ============== ===========================================================================================
Name         Optional Sample         Notes
============ ======== ============== ===========================================================================================
cid          ---      5dbe1a4d       Correlation ID - a unique identified assigned to each request received by Zato.
                                     Note that there may be multiple audit log entries with the same cid if a given request
                                     accessed or manipulated PII more than once. For audit entries emitted by Zato, the value
                                     of cid will the same as is stored in http_access.log for each received HTTP request
                                     which lets one easily establish which of HTTP calls result in which audit log item.
op           ---      get_user       A textual label for the operation
current_user Yes      usr1e39517     User ID of the account carrying out the operation - for entries written to log by Zato
                                     internally during SSO calls, it is guaranteed that this value will only contain
                                     randomly generated strings serving as user IDs, i.e. never usernames, display names
                                     or other PII
target_user  Yes      usr25ec935     User ID or username of the account on whose behalf a given operation is being performed,
                                     may possibly contain a username which in turn may be possibly PII (depending on how
                                     usernames are created)
result       Yes      ok             If applicable, result of the operation, e.g. "ok" if a certain call succeeded
extra        Yes      {"found":true} A dictionary of extra parameters related to the entry, does not have a fixed format
============ ======== ============== ===========================================================================================

The default log file is called *audit-pii.log* and is stored along with other log files, for instance, if path to a server is
/opt/zato/server1/logs then the audit log will be in /opt/zato/server1/logs/audit-pii.log.

Standard Python logging configuration from *logging.conf* applies to audit log which means it can be reconfigured to use
other log destinations such as syslog.

Python API
----------

From one's own services, the audit log is available through .info, .warn and .error methods of the *self.audit_pii* object,
as below. There is no requirement that cid given on input be self.cid - any suitable correlation identifier in a particular
situation may be used, Zato does not interpret it in any way.

::

  # -*- coding: utf-8 -*-

  from __future__ import absolute_import, division, print_function, unicode_literals

  # Zato
  from zato.server.service import Service

  class MyService(Service):
      def handle(self):
          self.audit_pii.info(self.cid, 'my-operation-on-info-level', 'user-id')
          self.audit_pii.warn(self.cid, 'my-operation-on-warn-level', 'user-id')
          self.audit_pii.error(self.cid, 'my-operation-on-error-level', 'user-id')

Each of .info, .warn and .error methods has the same arguments and signature. Only *cid* and *op* are required:

.. py:method:: info(self, cid, op, current_user='', target_user='', result='', extra='')
.. py:method:: warn(self, cid, op, current_user='', target_user='', result='', extra='')
.. py:method:: error(self, cid, op, current_user='', target_user='', result='', extra='')
