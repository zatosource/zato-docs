======================================================================================================

Usage example
-------------

::

    Feature: zato-apitest docs

    Scenario: Given XPath "{xpath}" in request is a random date between "{date_start}" and "{date_end}" "{format}"

        Given address "http://apitest-demo.zato.io"
        Given URL path "/demo/xml"
        Given format "XML"
        Given request is "<req><howdy>foo</howdy></req>"
        Given XPath "//howdy" in request is a random date between "2019-07-25" and "2031-01-29" "default"

        When the URL is invoked

        Then status is "200"

Discussion
----------

-  The format "default" is always available. Its value is
   "YYYY-MM-DDTHH:mm:ss".
-  Use format "YYYY-MM-DD" to specify "{date\_start}" and "{date\_end}".
