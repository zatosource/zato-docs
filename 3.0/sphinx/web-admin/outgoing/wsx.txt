Outgoing connections - WebSockets
==================================

Overview
--------

Used to list, create, update, and delete outgoing WebSocket connections. This type of connection lets one send messages to endpoints of two kinds:

* Arbitrary WebSockets
* Zato WebSocket :doc:`channels <../channels/wsx>`

The former is meant to be used if messages need to be sent to non-Zato based remote WebSockets, no matter what their underlying technology
or implementation are. The messages are sent without waiting for a response.

The latter are designed specifically to :doc:`invoke services <../../progguide/examples/wsx>` on remote Zato clusters and to
:doc:`subscribe to messages published <../../pubsub/index>` on remote clusters, thus allowing for Zato-to-Zato communication,
including synchronous invocations of remote services.

* Menu path: Connections -> Outgoing -> WebSockets
* Example address: http://localhost:8183/zato/outgoing/wsx/?cluster=1&type_=outconn-wsx

Header                Notes
===================== =====================================================================================================================
Name                  Connection name
Active                If False, no messages will be allowed to be sent through this connection
                      to the remote end
Is remote end Zato    If True, the remote end of this WebSocket connection will be understood to
                      be a Zato Web-Socket channel with service *helpers.web-sockets-gateway* mounted
                      on it. If False, the remote will be understood to be a generic WebSocket
                      endpoint.
Auto-reconnect        If True, connections to WebSocket endpoints will automatically try
                      to reconnect as soon as the remote server drop one. If False, a closed
                      connection will not be re-established until its Zato server is restarted.
Address               Full address of the endpoint to connect to, including protocol and URL path,
                      e.g. ws://10.152.19.37/myapp/wsx
On connect service    A :doc:`hook service <../../progguide/examples/wsx>` to invoke once a connection to the remote end is established
On message service    A :doc:`hook service <../../progguide/examples/wsx>` to invoke for each message received from the remote end
On close service      A :doc:`hook service <../../progguide/examples/wsx>` to invoke after the remote end closes the connection
Security              A username/password to use if the remote end requires authentication. Ignored if
                      "Is remote end Zato" is not True.
Pub/sub subscriptions A list of :doc:`pub/sub topics <../../pubsub/index>` to subscribe to once
                      the initial connection is created, each topic in its own line. Ignored if
                      "Is remote end Zato" is not True.
