Channels - SOAP
===============

Overview
--------

Used to create, update, delete and browse SOAP channels.

Unlike :doc:`REST channels <./plain-http>` that can accept data in any format,
SOAP ones expect it always to be a SOAP XML.

=================== ================================================================================
Header              Notes
=================== ================================================================================
Name                Channel name
Active              :ref:`Documented below <web-admin-channels-soap-active>`
URL path            A path to mount this channel on. Must be unique in a cluster. URL
                    path and SOAP action must be unique in a cluster.

Match slash         A boolean flag to control if slash characters should be taken into account
                    or skipped when matching patterns between braces, such as {cust_id}. If False,
                    a slash character will never be matched in such a pattern.

Method              *(Optional)* An HTTP method that must be used by clients to invoke
                    this particular channel. It can be any string and Zato won't check
                    if it's a valid HTTP 1.1 method. Leave empty to allow any method
                    be used.
Encoding            *(Optional)* Using what format responses should be encoded -
                    leave empty for no
                    encoding. Currently the only supported value is *gzip*.

Data format         *(Optional)* The expected data format Zato should parse
                    incoming messages as. This will also populate a service's
                    :ref:`data_format attribute <progguide-write-service-data_format>`.

                    For SOAP channels, this almost always should be set to XML
                    unless your channels are actually using SOAP for conveying
                    non-XML messages.

SOAP action         SOAP action this channel should be available as. URL path
                    and SOAP action must be unique in a cluster.

SOAP version        Currently only version 1.1 SOAP channels are supported.
                    Use a :doc:`plain HTTP <./plain-http>` channel with a service
                    which parses SOAP 1.2 itself if you need to expose services
                    through the latter version.

Service             Name of an already existing service to invoke for
                    each HTTP request received
Security definition Name of a security definition -
                    :doc:`HTTP Basic Auth <../security/basic-auth>`
                    or a
                    :doc:`WS-Security <../security/ws-security>` definition
                    - to use for securing the access to the channel.

                    Pick 'No security' explicitly to indicate that no such definition
                    should be used.  This can be used to expose certain services
                    without any
                    usernames or to indicate that a service will implement a custom
                    security scheme itself.
Cache               *(Optional)* Using what definitions responses from the channel should cached,
                    if at all
Expiry              *(Optional)* For how many minutes responses should be cached
=================== ================================================================================


Delete
------

.. image:: /gfx/web-admin/channels/soap-delete.png

Deletes the channel from ODB and servers. The channel won't exist anymore and invoking
a URL it was mounted on will return HTTP 404 error.

.. _web-admin-channels-soap-active:

The 'Active' flag
-----------------

If a channel is made inactive, an attempt to invoke it will result in an HTTP
404 error.
