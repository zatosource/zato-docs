Statistics maintenance
======================

Statistics need proper maintenance in order to avoid the unlimited growth
of Redis, the place where they're stored.

If you know you won't need information past or prior to a given date, you can
use a  maintenance form to delete unneeded data reclaiming disk space and RAM in this way.
