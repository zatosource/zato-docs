Configuration patterns
======================

Overview
--------

Several configuration stanzas in
:doc:`server.conf <./install-config/config-server>`
support the usage of string patterns to match in run-time. Regardless of the exact place
where it's used, the matching process works identically and is described in this chapter.

The entries that can be used with patterns are:

* :ref:`deploy_patterns_allowed <admin-guide-config-server-deploy_patterns_allowed>`
* :ref:`invoke_patterns_allowed <admin-guide-config-server-invoke_patterns_allowed>`
* :ref:`invoke_target_patterns_allowed <admin-guide-config-server-invoke_target_patterns_allowed>`

The first one will be used as a usage example but again, each of the supports the same mechanism in its own area.

How patterns work
-----------------

String patterns are used to provide a set of expressions evaluated in run-time that Zato uses to make decisions
in places where patterns are employed.

For instance:

::

   [deploy_patterns_allowed]
   order=true_false
   *=True
   crm.*=False
   billing.*.create=False

Each stanza must contain the *order* key with either of the following:

* *true_false* - In a first pass patterns that admit the given operation are matched. On top of that, patterns that forbid the operation are matched,
  possibly overriding results from the first pass.

* *false_true* - In a first pass patterns that disallow the given operation are matched. On top of that, patterns that grant the operation are matched,
  possibly overriding results from the first pass.

Each stanza will additionally add one or more patterns to match in run-time. If a string doesn't match any pattern, the result is False.

Patterns can use wildcard operators:

* *\*** - matches any string
* *\** - matches any string except for slash /
* *?* - matches a single character

Each pattern key is given a True or False value thus placing it in the list of patterns allowing or disallowing a given action.

Even if not provided in such a manner by users, patterns are always evaluated lexicographically within each True/False group
separately, with wildcard operators being considered less than characters.

Results of matching are cached and subsequent calls to evaluate the same pattern will be returned immediately. The cache does not
expire and to update patterns a change to
:doc:`server.conf <./install-config/config-server>`
is needed followed by a server restart (zato
:doc:`stop <../cli/stop>`/:doc:`start <../cli/start>`).

To special-case the most common configuration, if an entire stanza consists only of the *order* key followed by either
*\*=True* (as in the default configuration) or *\*=False*, a fast path evaluating to True/False, respectively, is taken each time
a decision is needed - hence even though both of the below work outwardly in the same manner, the result of a match is the same
value of False, the second one is faster:

::

    [deploy_patterns_allowed]
    order=true_false
    my.service.*=True
    *=False

::

    [deploy_patterns_allowed]
    order=true_false
    *=False

Usage examples
--------------

Allow everything
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

::

    [deploy_patterns_allowed]
    order=true_false
    *=True

Don't allow anything
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

::

    [deploy_patterns_allowed]
    order=true_false
    *=False

Allow all but reject a few selected
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

::

    [deploy_patterns_allowed]
    order=true_false
    *=True
    crm.*=False
    ivr.*.delete=False

Reject all but grant a few
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

::

    [deploy_patterns_allowed]
    order=false_true
    *=False
    customer.account.*=True
    customer.billing.*.get=True

Individually let a few in and reject several others
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

::

    [deploy_patterns_allowed]
    order=true_false
    customer.account.*=True
    customer.billing.*.get=True
    customer.account.address=False
    customer.phone.v1?=False

Recall that by default if a string doesn't much any pattern, it is rejected. Hence the configuration picking individual
names only will still work as though *\*=False* was provided.

Default configuration
---------------------

The default configuration is as follows:

::

    [deploy_patterns_allowed]
    order=true_false
    *=True

That is, match allowed entries then override with disallowed ones but by default - allow everything.
