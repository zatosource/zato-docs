Bash completion update
======================

Update process steps
--------------------

* Download and replace /etc/bash_completion.d/zato:

            https://raw.githubusercontent.com/zatosource/zato-build/master/bash_completion/zato


You can logout and login to refresh the bash session or you can do the next step to reload Bash completion staying in the same session:
