Installing an SQL ODB
=====================

-----

* Install one of the supported databases

  * PostgreSQL 9.x+
  * MySQL/MariaDB 5.5+

Note: SQLite is one of the supported databases as well but doesn't need manual installation beforehand.

* Create a user for Zato servers

* (PostgreSQL only) Create a separate schema for Zato

* Make Zato user the owner of the database created or grant it permissions to issue DDL
  statements

* Issue the :doc:`zato create odb <../../cli/create-odb>` command

* Revoke any DDL rights given to the Zato user
