Installing a scheduler
======================

Steps
-----

* Make sure `Redis <http://redis.io>`_ is installed and started
* :doc:`Install an ODB <./install-odb>`
* :doc:`Install a cluster's config <./install-cluster>`
* Prepare crypto material, in PEM, with no passwords, for the scheduler to use:

  * Public key
  * Private key
  * Certificate
  * A list of CA certificates the scheduler can trust

  Note that Zato ships with :doc:`a simple CA <../../cli/ca>`
  that can be used in development environments.

* Issue the :doc:`zato create scheduler <../../cli/create-scheduler>` command

* Make sure that at least one server is fully started before starting a new scheduler instance - this is needed because
  the scheduler expects for a set of metadata to have been created by one of servers (no matter which, any will suffice)

* Start the scheduler using the :doc:`zato start <../../cli/start>` command
