Installing the certificate authority
====================================

Steps
-----

* Prepare an empty directory to store the CA in
* Issue the :doc:`zato ca create ca <../../cli/ca-create-ca>` command

.. note ::

   The CA should be used for development only, it's not a full-featured solution
   and there are no plans to make it become one.
