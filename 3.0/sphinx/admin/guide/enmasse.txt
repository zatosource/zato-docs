Managing server objects en masse
================================

Overview
--------

In addition to the :doc:`GUI <../../web-admin/intro>`, :doc:`CLI <../cli/index>`
and :doc:`API <../../public-api/intro>`, you can use the
`enmasse <https://zato.io/download/enmasse>`_ command line tool to manage
server objects as a group. This lets you store each object configuration in
YAML or JSON files, in a repository where they can be versioned or backed up
and to use enmasse to perform roll-outs from command line without the use of
GUI or other methods.

Enmasse handles backup and restore of server objects, includign channels,
scheduler jobs, security definitions, etc. It specifically does not manage
user services; service management is documented in :doc:`a separate chapter
<./installing-services>`.

Tasks you can use enmasse for
-----------------------------

* Exporting server objects from a cluster as text in YAML or JSON format.
* Preparing cluster configuration and merging it with a contents
  of an already existing cluster
* Importing objects from an export file into clusters, optionally replacing objects that already exist

Usage scenarios
---------------

* You create a development cluster and quickly prototype a solution using the
  :doc:`GUI <../../web-admin/intro>`. For tests and production, however, you prefer
  to store the config in a git repository. Hence you use enmasse to export all server
  objects from a dev cluster into JSON. The JSON is next imported to tests and later on,
  on production.

* You have an already existing cluster and want to add or replace server objects.
  You prepare a JSON config file and import it to a cluster.

* You have a team of programmers each responsible for a part of a solution and you
  want to limit the number of conflicts in a central config repository. You split
  the local config file into multiple smaller ones, each of which can be
  included by enmasse to form a whole that will be imported as a single unit.

Workflow
--------

* Either export objects from an already existing cluster to a file, or create
  the file from scratch, the format is given in later sections.

* Customize the file, optionally splitting it into smaller units that can be
  included later on.

* Combine all the includes, optionally merging ODB objects from a cluster of choice,
  into an export file. This is a file that can be imported to clusters. Note that
  its format is not documented and may change without prior notice.

* Import objects from an export file, optionally replacing objects that already
  exist in a cluster.

Notes
~~~~~

* Both --export-* arguments always need an input JSON file in --input, if you're
  just starting out, put an empty dictionary {} to the file, but remember that
  it must exist and must not be empty.

* Path to a server is always required and serves a double role.

  If you're exporting data it must be path to a running
  server you're exporting data from. Just point it to any existing server directory even if you're
  not exporting data from ODB. The requirement to point path to a server even if
  ODB is not used will be lifted in future versions.

  If you're importing data, the path must point to a running server you're importing data into.

* For exports, --input means an input file out of which an export file should be created.

  For imports, --input is an export file out of which definitions should be imported on a cluster.

* For imports, the order enmasse works in is guaranteed to be:

  * Existing definitions are updated
  * Existing objects other than definitions are updated
  * New definitions are created
  * New objects other than definitions are created

  This way, objects that depend on definitions can be sure the definitions
  they need already exist in the ODB.

* If channels or outgoing connections are active and they require connectors,
  the connectors will be started right away. This may mean a flurry of activity on a cluster's
  connector server. It may be worthwhile to consider whether such channels and outgoing
  connection should not be imported in an inactive state, enabling them manually later on.

* When creating an export file, enmasse tries to report as many warnings and errors
  in one go as possible. When importing a file, it does the contrary, and will stop as soon
  as it encounters anything it can't deal with to give you a chance to have a look
  at an erroneous situation as early as it can be done.

      Data exported to /opt/zato/zato-export-2013-06-12T20_10_19_874355.json
      $

* Creating an export file out of another file, pulling all includes and any
  non-Zato internal objects from ODB in along

  ::

      $ zato enmasse /opt/server1/ --input input1.yml --export-local --export-odb
      Includes merged in successfully
      ODB objects read
      ODB objects merged in
      Data exported to /opt/zato/zato-export-2013-06-12T20_11_57_306991.yml
      $

Dissecting a config file
------------------------

.. note ::

  * Unlike when using the GUI or API, the security definition names you use must be unique
    in a cluster. That is, not only there cannot be, say, two HTTP Basic Auth
    definitions known as 'mysecurity-def' but it's an error to have a HTTP
    Basic Auth and a technical account or a WS-Security one under this name.

  * If a given HTTP object, such as a channel or an outgoing connection,
    should not use any security definition ('sec_def') at all, you should use a special
    constant string 'zato-no-security' to signal it. It cannot be None/null,
    it must be this exact string.

Configuration is kept in a JSON or YAML file that contains a dictionary of
well-known keys and a list of values for each key.

Keys are the types of server objects the config contains. Values are objects
themselves written either as dictionaries or as links to files containing
the configuration of each object individually - one file is one object. If not
absolute, paths to files are relative to the main config file.

All the supported keys are discussed below. For values, they're almost always
equivalent to API calls used to manage them and only differences are documented.

You never use any IDs in JSON config files, only human-readable names and types are used.

Passwords are always given in clear-text.

When using definitions, they don't necessarily have to exist anywhere at the time
the input JSON is created however a warning will be displayed if an object depends
on a definition which doesn't exist at that time - you can skip displaying this warning using
the --ignore-missing-defs switch when invoking enmasse. This may makes sense if you
know that such definitions will be available at the time the export file will be imported
into a cluster.

Sample YAML Files
-----------------

input1.yml
~~~~~~~~~~

Top-level configuration files are YAML dictionaries, where each key is a list
of objects.

.. code-block:: yaml

    ---

    def_sec:
    # Define a HTTP basic authentication definition with a password set.
    - type: basic_auth
      name: mybasicauth
      real: myrealm
      password: mypassword1
      is_active: true
      username: mybasicauthuser

    outconn_plain_http:
    # Define an outgoing HTTP connection using the associated auth definition.
    - name: myhttp1
      sec_def: mybasicauth
      host: test11.example.com
      connection: outgoing
      is_active: true
      is_internal: false
      transport: plain-http
      url_path: /out/1

    scheduler:
    # Create a scheduled job using an include file from the same directory as input1.yml.
    - file://./include1.yml


include1.yml
~~~~~~~~~~~~

Included configuration files are also YAML dictionaries, however they do not
specify a type, and the item's fields are defined directly in the top-level
directionary.

.. code-block:: yaml

  ---

  name: my_job
  is_active: true
  job_type: interval
  service: my.service

  # Be careful! In YAML, many special characters and reserved words exist. For
  # example, the word "no" is interpreted as boolean False, as are the words
  # "yes", "true", etc.  Other special characters introduce data constructs.
  # When in doubt, simply quote the entire field, as shown here.
