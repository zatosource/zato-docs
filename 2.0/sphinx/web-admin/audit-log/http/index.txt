HTTP Audit Log
==============

The audit log provides a set of GUI screens that let one catch the flow of incoming HTTP connections in the
:doc:`SQL ODB <../../../architecture/sql-odb>`.

Both requests and responses, including full HTTP and
`WSGI <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_Server_Gateway_Interface>`_
headers, can be saved and a set of
:doc:`JSON Pointers <../../messages/json-pointer>`
or
:doc:`XPath <../../messages/xpath>`
expressions can be used to mask out sensitive data
such as authentication tokens or credit card numbers.

Stored data can be searched and displayed, including the ability to look up messages by their payload, headers or
:ref:`Correlation IDs <progguide-write-service-cid>`.

Subsequent chapters deal with details of configuring and using the audit log:

* :doc:`Configuring <channel/config>`
* :doc:`Searching <channel/search>`
* :doc:`Displaying details <channel/details>`
