Deletes the consumer. Doesn't delete the underlying client the consumer was based on.

Clearing messages
-----------------

Messages can be removed from consumer queues using two means and which one to choose depends on the state of messages
concerned.

=================== =============================================================================
Option              Notes
=================== =============================================================================
Clear msg queue     Removes all the messages that have not yet been seen by the consumer
Clear in-flight     Removes all the messages that the consumer possibly have seen but for any
                    reason does not confirm they been read. For instance, if the consumer
                    uses callback URLs but the URL times out when Zato attempts to deliver
                    the messages.
=================== =============================================================================

Message browsing
----------------

Messages that are still in a consumer's queue can be browsed, including the ability to obtain their payload and metadata.
