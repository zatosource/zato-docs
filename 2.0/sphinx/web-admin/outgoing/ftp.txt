Outgoing connections - FTP
==========================

Overview
--------

Used to create, update, delete and browse through outgoing FTP connections.

Each usage of a connection by a service establishes a new link to the FTP
server, i.e. there is no connection pool created in the background, each time
a new service connects to a server a new FTP connection is needed. Within a 
single instance of a service only a single connection to the FTP server 
is maintained though.

* Menu path: Connections -> Outgoing -> FTP
* Example address: http://localhost:8183/zato/outgoing/ftp/?cluster=1
