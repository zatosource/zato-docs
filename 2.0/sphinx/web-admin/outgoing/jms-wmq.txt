Outgoing connections - JMS WebSphere MQ
=======================================

Overview
--------

Used to create, update, delete and browse through outgoing JMS WebSphere MQ connections.

Each outgoing connection represents a link through which MQ messages are 
sent by Zato services.

Creating or updating a connection (re-)establishes a link to a queue manager
and there are as many connectors and connections to any queue manager as there are 
active outgoing connections and :doc:`channels <../channels/jms-wmq>` in a cluster.

For instance, if there is 1 
:doc:`definition <../conn-def/jms-wmq>` and 5 outgoing connections using it, there will
be 5 connector processes started in a cluster each maintaining 1 connection
to the queue manager pointed to by the definition.

Sending messages to a queue manager is an asynchronous activity - messages are not
rolled back to Zato services if there are any errors
along.

Delete
------

Stops the underlying connector and deletes the connection from ODB.

The 'Active' flag
-----------------

If an **outgoing connection** is made **inactive** and there are services still making
use of it, the **messages** services send **will be lost**. 

You need to ensure no service is able to reach an outgoing connection before
it's turned off - otherwise **you will lose messages**.

Also an inactive outgoing connection closes its underlying link to a queue manager
but the connector's process continues to run.
