Connection definitions - JMS WebSphere MQ
=========================================

Overview
--------

Used to create, update, delete and browse 
`JMS <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Java_Message_Service>`_
`WebSphere MQ <http://www-03.ibm.com/software/products/us/en/wmq>`_
connection definitions.

A definition is a template off of which a concrete connection, either 
:doc:`channel <../channels/jms-wmq>`
or an 
:doc:`outgoing one<../outgoing/jms-wmq>`,
is created. Merely creating a definition doesn't start a connection to a queue manager.

One definition can serve to create multiple channels or outgoing connections.

Only JMS connections are supported - it's not possible to send or receive plain MQ
messages.

The JMS support is completely transparent - from a Java application's point
of view Zato will seem to be a Java application as well.

.. note ::

  Before connecting to queue managers, 
  `PyMQI <https://github.com/dsuch/pymqi>`_
  :ref:`needs to be enabled first <admin-guide-enabling-extra-libs-pymqi>`.

* Menu path: Connections -> Definitions -> JMS WebSphere MQ
* Example address: http://localhost:8183/zato/definition/jms-wmq/?cluster=1

Header                       Notes
============================ ==============================================================
Name                         Definition's name
Host                         Queue manager's host
Port                         Queue manager's listener's port
Queue manager                Queue manager's name
Channel                      Name of SVRCONN channel to connect through
Cache open send queues       If queues open for sending should be cached for a later use,
                             or should they be open for each MQPUT operation
Cache open receive queues    *(Currently unused and should be set to True)*
Use shared connections       Queue managers running on z/OS mainframe don't support 
                             shared client connections - untick this option if a queue
                             manager is on z/OS
Use SSL                      Whether the connection should use SSL/TLS
SSL cipher spec              If connecting with SSL, a cipher spec to use (not cipher 
                             suite)
SSL key repository           If connecting with SSL, a path to an SSL key repository, 
                             the type of which must be CMS (not JKS)
Needs MCD folder             Set to True for MQ 6.0 or older
Max characters printed       When running in DEBUG mode, how many characters of
                             messages passing through to write out to logs

Delete
------

.. image:: /gfx/web-admin/conn-def/jms-wmq-delete.png

Deletes a JMS WebSphere MQ definition and all the connections that make use of it.

.. note ::

  It needs to be emphasized that any channels or outgoing
  connections that were using the definition will also be deleted automatically.
