Service details - WSDL
======================

Overview
--------

Lets one upload a service's WSDL. The file size limit is 5 MB. Use zip, bzip2
or similar tools to compress larger WSDLs before assigning them to a service.

The WSDL's contents is not inspected, validated or parsed. It's stored as is
and is not used by Zato itself for anything, such as for checking whether
incoming requests are WSDL-conformant.

* Menu path: Services -> (find a service and clicks its name) -> WSDL
* Example address: http://localhost:8183/zato/service/wsdl/zato.ping/?cluster=1
