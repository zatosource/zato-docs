Statistics maintenance
======================

Statistics need proper maintenance in order to avoid the unlimited growth
of Redis, the place where they're stored.

If you know you won't need information past or prior to a given date, you can 
use a  maintenance form to delete unneeded data.

The same can also be achieved using 
:doc:`the API <../public-api/details/zato.stats.delete>`
- for instance, a custom 
:doc:`sheduler's job <../progguide/scheduler>`
or an external tool
can invoke the service periodically in order to reclaim space.
