License and getting involved
============================

Want to contribute ideas or code? **Superb!** The project is under `LGPL <https://github.com/zatosource/zato/blob/master/LICENSE.txt>`_
- a liberal license allowing for pretty much unlimited usage and modifications.

* Programmers should familiarize themselves with 
  `the source code on GitHub <https://github.com/zatosource/zato/>`_.
  Fork and send patches at will! :-)
  
  * Most of the server's code is written in Python on top of 
    `gunicorn <http://gunicorn.org>`_ and a dozen of other libraries
  
  * The web admin frontend is written using Django, jQuery and a bit of other JS libraries
  
  * All other parts are in Python and make heavy use of other open-source projects,
    there are 
    `150+ dependencies listed in buildout.cfg <https://github.com/zatosource/zato/blob/master/code/buildout.cfg>`_

* Designers are always needed to help make 
  `the website <https://zato.io>`_, 
  :doc:`documentation <../index>`
  and
  :doc:`Zato itself <../web-admin/intro>`
  even more prettier!
  
* Wanna send a quick documentation patch or suggestion? Just 
  `open a new ticket in GitHub <https://github.com/zatosource/zato/issues>`_
  
* Packagers are wanted to :doc:`help port Zato to more platforms <../admin/guide/install-zato>`

* Always feel welcome to join the friendly `mailing list <https://mailman-mail5.webfaction.com/listinfo/zato-discuss>`_ 
  and `IRC <https://webchat.freenode.net/?channels=zato>`_ if you'd like to help other community 
  members out or just chat in general
  
And remember - Zato project is all about tolerance - make sure you always act
