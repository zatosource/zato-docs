  * Most of the server's code is written in Python on top of 
    `gunicorn <http://gunicorn.org>`_ and a dozen of other libraries

  * The web admin frontend is written using Django, jQuery and a bit of other JS libraries

  * All other parts are in Python and make heavy use of other open-source projects,

    many dependencies listed in `buildout.cfg <https://github.com/zatosource/zato/blob/support/2.0/code/buildout.cfg>`_
