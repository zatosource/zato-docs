BST - Authoring definitions
===========================

Overview
--------

:doc:`BST <./index>` definitions list transitions between states a given business objects goes through during its lifetime.
For instance, an order from a customer will have at least several clearly defined states it needs to pass before the process is complete.

A BST definition may have multiple entry and end points. A state may transition onto itself. Each definition may contain a list
of states that interrupt a given process forcibly, such as Canceled or Rejected indicating a business condition under which
the process for the business object should be stopped.

Each definition is a text file with a series of entries in plain English, such as:

::

    Orders
    ------

    Objects: Order, Priority order
    New: Submitted
    Submitted: Ready
    Ready: Sent
    Sent: Confirmed, Rejected
    Rejected: Updated
    Updated: Ready
    Force stop: Canceled, Timed out

Such files, no matter their extension which may be .txt, are placed in a Zato server's *config/repo/proc/bst* directory out of which
they are picked up when the server is starting. The same definitions files need to be used across all the servers in a single Zato
cluster.

After changing the definition file all servers using it need to be restarted - the next major Zato release will lift this requirement.

To delete a definition, remove the file it's contained in fr from *config/repo/proc/bst* of all servers and restart the servers.

During development and on production it's possible to output definitions to .PNG diagrams as described below.

Each definition is in its own file. Likewise, each version of the same definition must be in its own file.

Any line starting with *#* is ignored. Leading and trailing whitespace in lines is insignificant but whitespace is kept intact
within names of definitions and states.

What definitions are composed of
--------------------------------

A definition begins with its name, followed by objects it operates on, states, transitions and a list of forced stop states.
The order of entries is not relevant as long as the name is the first item in the file.

Names
~~~~~

Each definition starts with its name followed by one or more dashes to indicate that what follows next is the actual body
of the definition. To improve clarity an empty line may be added after the dashes.

Example names:

::

  Feasibility study
  -----------------

::

  Open account
  ------------

Objects
~~~~~~~

BST definitions must list what business objects they are concerned with. An object is an arbitrary textual label attached to a
definition in the *Objects:* line. The same object may be used in multiple definitions or different version of the same
definition. A single definition may list more than one object.

One object in the definition:

::

  Feasibility study
  -----------------

  Objects: Landline

Two objects in the definition:

::

  Feasibility study
  -----------------

  Objects: Landline, Gigabit

States and transitions
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

States are listed after the definition's name. Each state points to one ore more further states one is allowed to move
a business object to.

Each state is defined by the virtue of its being first time used as either a source or one of target states in a transition.
It's not mandatory to declare states upfront before they are used.

If no state points to a given state, the latter is considered one of start states in the definition. Conversely,
if a state doesn't lead to at least state it is considered an end state, possibly one of many end states in the definition.

A two-step definition:

::

  Open account
  ------------

  Objects: Customer
  Consent given: Has account

A three-step definition:

::

  Open account
  ------------

  Objects: Customer
  Consent given: Has account
  Has account: Welcome message sent

Looping and branching:

::

  Open account
  ------------

  Objects: Customer
  log_in: consent_given, consent_declined
  consent_given: has_account
  has_account: logged_in, needs_confirmation
  needs_confirmation: has_account

Multiple begin and end states:

::

  Open account
  ------------

  Objects: Customer
  Consent given: Has account
  Migrated: Has account
  Has account: Logged in, Suspended

Forced stop states
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Each definition can optionally list one or more states upon entering which the instance of a process will unconditionally
stop no matter what the current state is. Such states are listed in the *Force stop:* line, as below.

::

  Open account
  ------------

  Objects: Customer
  Consent given: Has account
  Force stop: Canceled

Versioning
~~~~~~~~~~

Definitions can be given an explicit version using the *Version:* entry. If no version is provided by users, it's set to 1.

::

  Open account
  ------------

  Objects: Customer
  Consent given: Has account
  Version: 35.1

Useful API calls
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

/bst/get-definition-list

Calling this endpoint will return all the currently available definitions as pretty-printed JSON:

::

  $ curl http://bst:$PWD@localhost:17010/bst/get-definition-list
  [
    {
      "Open account": {
        "objects": "Customer",
        "Consent given": "Has account",
        "Migrated": "Has account",
        "Has account": [
          "Logged in",
          "Suspended"
        ],
        "version": "3a1"
      }
    },
    {
      "Open account old": {
        "objects": "Customer",
        "Consent given": "Has account",
        "Has account": "Welcome message sent"
      }
    }
  ]
