BST - Zato programmer's guide
=============================

Basic usage
-----------

Instances of :doc:`BST <./index>` definitions transition through states as instructed to be either Zato services or external
:doc:`REST <./rest>` clients - this chapter is concerned with the former.

From a Zato programmer's perspective to change state of a business object, one needs to wrap a service's business logic
in a dedicated *with transition_to* block, as below:

::

  # Zato
  from zato.server.service import Service

  # zato-labs
  from zato_bst import transition_to

  class MyService(Service):

    def handle(self):

      with transition_to(self, 'Order', 123, 'ready'):

        # Here goes the actual user code
        pass

Before proceeding to the user code, the with block will:

* Ensure that there exists an *Order* object with an ID of *123* in the cache of objects already seen and that from its current
  state it is possible to transition the object to the new state of *ready*. If any of it is not true, raise an exception.

* If the object is not found in the cache but *ready* is one of begin states, don't raise an exception. This is how a series
  of transitions for an object starts - there is no separate 'start_transitions* call.

* Likewise, if a state that the object transitions to is one of end ones, this ends the transitions - there is no dedicated
  'end_transitions' call.

Business objects may belong to multiple BST :doc:`definitions <./author>` hence it's also possible to specify the exact name
and version of the definition a given business object belongs to.

Zato programmers can also explicitly force an object to a new state even though it would normally be rejected by the underlying
state machine, such as when no transition existed from the object's old and the desired new state.

Each transition can be attached an arbitrary string of context data, for instance to serve as a user-provided metadata for
the transition.

Providing definition name and version
-------------------------------------

If a business object belongs in one or more BST definition or if users want to be explicit about which definition to use,
*def_name* and, optionally, *def_version* parameters can be used to point to the one exact definition required.

Without the parameters, a definition is looked up based on the business object. If more than one definition uses it an exception
will be raised before the with block gets executed.

::

    # Use definition name
    with transition_to(self, 'Order', 123, 'ready', 'CRM orders'):

      # Here goes the actual user code
      pass

::

    # Use definition name + version
    with transition_to(self, 'Order', 123, 'ready', 'CRM orders', '6.1'):

      # Here goes the actual user code
      pass

.. _proc-bst-progguide-force:

Forcing a transition
--------------------

By providing the *force=True* parameter, users can always force a transition to a new state of a business object even
if the object is already in one of end states or no transition for the object occurred at all yet, effectively bypassing
normal rules of transitions in the definition. The new state must still exist in a given definition, i.e. its name must be valid.

::

  # Disregard current state and jump directly to 'sent-to-user'
  with transition_to(self, 'Order', 123, 'sent-to-user', force=True):
  
    # Here goes the actual user code
    pass

Providing user context
----------------------

Users can add arbitrary string of opaque data to a transition between states. It's possible to provide it either to
*transition_to* directly or later on within the with block, depending on what is more convenient or if the string of data
is already known at the time transition_to is called.

::

  # Add user context to transition_to directly
  with transition_to(self, 'Order', 123, 'ready', user_ctx="My data"):
  
    # Here goes the actual user code
    pass

::

  # Call an external system and add user_ctx based on response
  with transition_to(self, 'Order', 123, 'ready') as t:
  
    # Here an external system returns a response ..
    response = self.call_system()

    # .. part of which is added to the transition's context.
    t.ctx = response.user_id


Exceptions
----------

Should anything go awry, for instance, if it's not possible to transition to a new state, the exception raise will be that
of *zato_bst.TransitionError*.

::

  # Zato
  from zato.server.service import Service

  # zato-labs
  from zato_bst import transition_to, TransitionError

  class MyService(Service):

    def handle(self):

      try:
        with transition_to(self, 'Order', 123, 'ready'):

          # Here goes the actual user code
          pass

      except TransitionError, e:
          # Error handling goes here
          pass
