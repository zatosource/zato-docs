Installation under AWS Elastic Beanstalk
============================================================================

* Download an archive with Zato quickstart configuration for AWS Elastic Beanstalk:

::

    $ wget https://zato.io/download/awsebs/quickstart/zato-quickstart.zip

* In your browser, navigate to the EC2 console's AWS Elastic Beanstalk tab and create a new single-instance Docker environment

* Use 'Upload and Deploy' option to create a new Zato quickstart based on the *zato-quickstart.zip* archive

* Still in the EC2 console, add or modify a security group in order to access the instance hosting Zato

* Connect to the instance via SSH using a key pair of your choice

* While connected to the instance, get Zato Docker container ID:

::

    $ sudo docker ps


* Retrieve zato user and web-admin's passwords by running the following command:

::

    $ sudo docker exec -it <container-id-or-name> /bin/bash \
        -c 'cat /opt/zato/web_admin_password /opt/zato/zato_user_password'

* You can now log into Zato web-admin console at ``http://<your-esb-instance>:8183``

That concludes the process - you can refer to the main
:doc:`documentation index <../../../index>`
now.
