Installing Zato from source code
================================

Requirements
------------

* Ubuntu, RHEL/CentOS or Debian
* Sudo powers

Installation steps
------------------

* Check out the source code from `GitHub <https://github.com/zatosource/>`_ and enter the newly created directory

::

    $ git clone https://github.com/zatosource/zato && cd zato/code
    Cloning into 'zato'...
    [snip]
    code$


* Run the installer. If required, it will be ask for a password to sudo:

::

    code$ ./install.sh
    [snip]

* Wait for the installer to complete - it can take 10+ minutes depending on CPU and network connectivity.
  If for any reason the installation stops (for instance if a connection to PyPI times out), run the following
  commands to resume it:

::

    code$ ./bin/python bootstrap.py -v 1.7.0
    code$ ./bin/buildout

* Confirm the installation

::

    code$ ./bin/zato --version
    Zato 3.0.0pre1.rev-21dbcdfa
    code$

That concludes the process - you can refer to the main
:doc:`documentation index <../../../index>`
now.
