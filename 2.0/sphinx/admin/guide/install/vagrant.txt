Using zato-2.0.8-trusty64 box
===============================

This box is pre-build with Zato 2.0.8 installation. Using our Vagrantfile
allows one to have Zato quckstart environment created and running.

Requirements
------------

* Vagrant
* VirtualBox

Usage instructions
------------------

* Download Vagrantfile

::

  $ wget https://zato.io/download/vagrant/Vagrantfile \
      https://zato.io/download/vagrant/setup-quickstart.sh


* Start the box after the download is complete. Zato quickstart environment
  will be created.

::

  $ vagrant up

* Reload the box to start all Zato components as system services.

::

  $ vagrant reload

* In order to access Zato web-admin, you need to retrive the password:

::

  $ vagrant ssh -c 'cat /opt/zato/web_admin_password'

* Navigate to http://10.77.77.77:8183 and log into the web-admin

* If you want to log into the box, execute:

::

  $ vagrant ssh

* While inside the box, you can switch to 'zato' user and check Zato version

::

  vagrant$ sudo su - zato
  zato$ zato --version
  Zato 2.0.8.rev-050c6697
  zato$


That concludes the process - you can refer to the main
:doc:`documentation index <../../../index>`
now.
