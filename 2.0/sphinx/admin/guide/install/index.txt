Migrating from major releases
-----------------------------

:doc:`A separate chapter <../migrate/overview>` with upgrade information documents the process of migrating from
previous major releases to the current one.

Patch releases
--------------

Each major version, such as 2.0, is periodically updated with newest patches and as whole form patch releases,
such as 2.0.7 or 2.0.8. Each such release is available in a repository for a given operating system.

Use tools supplied by the OS, such as apt-get or yum, to update to the newest patch release. No migration process is required
afterwards.

Note that after installing the newest patch release the previous one is kept in */opt/zato/backup* - this is in order to make sure
that no user customizations are lost after the installation.
