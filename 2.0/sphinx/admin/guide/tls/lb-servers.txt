SSL/TLS traffic from a load-balancer to servers
===============================================

Key features:

* A cluster's HAProxy-based load-balancer can connect to servers using an encrypted SSL/TLS link
* Servers can be configured to require a client certificate from the load-balancer
* Connections from the load-balancer to servers can be encrypted even if connections from client applications to the load-balancer
  are not

Tasks
-----

* Configuring a load-balancer and servers to use :ref:`use SSL/TLS without client certificates <admin-tls-lb-no-certs>`
* Configuring a load-balancer and servers to use :ref:`use SSL/TLS with client certificates <admin-tls-lb-certs>`

.. _admin-tls-lb-no-certs:

SSL/TLS from a load-balancer to servers - no client certificates
----------------------------------------------------------------

* For each server in a cluster:

  * Open :doc:`server.conf <../install-config/config-server>` and set *crypto.use_tls* to True, so it reads:

    .. code-block:: ini

      [crypto]
      use_tls=True

  * Restart the server

* Open the load-balancer's configuration in :doc:`source code view <../../../web-admin/load-balancer/source-code>`

* Find lines referring to servers - contained within the *ZATO begin backend bck_http_plain* block, such as below.
  Note that the example shown splits a long line into several ones but the line must be kept long without newlines:

  .. code-block:: text

      server http_plain--server1 127.0.0.1:17010 \
        check inter 2s rise 2 fall 2 \
        # ZATO backend bck_http_plain:server--server1

* Add TLS-related configuration, including a path to CA certificates in *ca-file* which points to CA(s) the
  server certificates are signed off by, using the example below as a template. Again, all pieces should be placed
  on one line which has been broken out into multiple ones for clarity:

  .. code-block:: text
      :emphasize-lines: 3,4

        server http_plain--server1 127.0.0.1:17010 \
          check inter 2s rise 2 fall 2 \
          ssl verify required \
          ca-file /path/to/ca.cert.pem  \
          # ZATO backend bck_http_plain:server--server1

* Validate and save the load-balancer's configuration

.. _admin-tls-lb-certs:

SSL/TLS from a load-balancer to servers - with client certificates
------------------------------------------------------------------

* For each server in a cluster:

  * Open :doc:`server.conf <../install-config/config-server>` and set:
  
    * *crypto.use_tls* to True:
    * *crypto.tls_client_certs* to required

    .. code-block:: ini

      [crypto]
      use_tls=True
      tls_client_certs=required

  * Restart the server

* Open the load-balancer's configuration in :doc:`source code view <../../../web-admin/load-balancer/source-code>`

* Find lines referring to servers - contained within the *ZATO begin backend bck_http_plain* block, such as below.
  Note that the example shown splits a long line into several ones but the line must be kept long without newlines:

  .. code-block:: text

      server http_plain--server1 127.0.0.1:17010 \
        check inter 2s rise 2 fall 2 \
        # ZATO backend bck_http_plain:server--server1

* Add TLS-related configuration, including a path to CA certificates in *ca-file* which points to CA(s) the
  server certificates are signed off by, and *crt* containing the load-balancer's private key and certificate,
  using the example below as a template. Again, all pieces should be placed
  on one line which has been broken out into multiple ones for clarity:

  .. code-block:: text
      :emphasize-lines: 3,4,5

        server http_plain--server1 127.0.0.1:17010 \
          check inter 2s rise 2 fall 2 \
          ssl verify required \
          ca-file /path/to/ca.cert.pem  \
          crt /path/to/key-cert.pem  \
          # ZATO backend bck_http_plain:server--server1

* Validate and save the load-balancer's configuration
