Where to keep configuration
===========================

This chapter discusses several approaches as to where to keep configuration 
that is specific to services you develop, i.e. it's not about how to configure Zato itself, rather where to
keep run-time parameters you will want to use in your own services.

In short, you can keep it anywhere you want, in any data source and you're not limited
to the choices described here but these are still recommendations you may want to
consider using.

.. _progguide-service-local-config-ini:

INI files
---------

Each server's server.conf  file contains the :ref:`user_config <admin-guide-config-server-user_config>` stanza whose
keys are labels pointing to paths the contents of which is made available to services in run-time.

Assuming the configuration is:

::

   [user_config]
   data1=./my1.ini
   data2=/opt/data/my2.ini

The contents of files will be available to services as:

================= ===========================================
File              Attribute
================= ===========================================
./my1.ini         self.user_config.data1
/opt/data/my2.ini self.user_config.data2
================= ===========================================

Now supposing one of the files looks like:

./my1.ini:

::

   [hello]
   a_string=My string
   a_list=sample,list,with,elements

The exact values from the INI file will be converted to their expected Python types:

::

   from zato.server.service import Service
   
   class MyService(Service):
   
       def handle(self):
           self.logger.info('INI string %r ', self.user_config.data1.my1.hello.a_string)
           self.logger.info('INI list %r ', self.user_config.data1.my1.hello.a_list)

::

   INFO - INI string 'My string'
   INFO - INI list ['sample', 'list', 'with', 'elements']

The conversion works for strings and lists. If anything cannot be converted it is treated as a string.

zato_extra_paths
----------------

:doc:`zato_extra_paths <../admin/guide/enabling-extra-libs>` is a directory to
keep extra libraries that are not part of Zato. When a server is starting,
anything that is on zato_extra_paths - either directly or through symlinks - will
be added to PYTHONPATH.

This allows one to import values from a config library simply like from any other Python
module.

The drawback is, any changes you make to the config module won't be automatically
picked up, each server needs to be restarted manually for new changes to take effect.

::

   config = {'key1':'value1', 'key2':'value2', 'key3':'value3'}

::

   # Your app
   from myconfig import config
   
   # Zato
   from zato.server.service import Service
   
   class MyService(Service):
       def handle(self):
           self.logger.info(config)
           
::

   INFO - {'key3': 'value3', 'key2': 'value2', 'key1': 'value1'}
   
Redis
-----

You can use the :doc:`Redis GUI <../web-admin/kvdb/remote-commands>`,
:doc:`API <../public-api/details/zato.kvdb.remote-command.execute>`
or any other external tools (such as redis-cli)
to set config values and have services :doc:`fetch them<./kvdb>` in run-time.

You have access to any features Redis supports and can store arbitrarily complex
configuration in that manner.

Redis will be consulted each time a config value is needed so any new changes will
be visible to the services straightaway.

   from zato.server.service import Service
   
   class MyService(Service):
       def handle(self):
           value = self.kvdb.conn.get('mykey1')
           self.logger.info('value:[{}]'.format(value))
   
::

    INFO - value:[myvalue1]
    
A config service
----------------

You can store configuration in plain Python in a :doc:`SimpleIO-based (SIO) <./sio>` 
service designated to a role of a config service. This will be a service that itself won't usually accept
any external requests nor will it be allowed to invoke it through a channel
or scheduler.

As with Redis, such an approach lets you 
:doc:`hot-deploy <../admin/guide/installing-services>`
any config changes without restarting
the servers.

Note that any config values must always be assigned to a class directly - never
to an instance (self). As described in the 
:ref:`programming conventions <progguide-conventions>` section, this is because each invocation 
of a service creates a new instance.

Being a SIO one, you can invoke it with regular Python dicts or anything dict-like.

Note however that there is no guarantee as to in what order services are deployed
on servers, hence, you must ensure that such a service is available to its users
before other services start accessing it.

::

   from zato.server.service import Service
   
   class MyConfigService(Service):
       
       config = {
           'mykey1':'myvalue1',
           'mykey2':'myvalue2'
       }
       
       class SimpleIO(object):
           response_elem = 'config'
           input_required = ('key',)
           output_required = ('value',)
           
       def handle(self):
           self.response.payload.value = self.config.get(self.request.input.key, 'err')
           
::

   from zato.server.service import Service
   
   class MyService(Service):
       def handle(self):
           config_service = 'my-services.my-config-service'
           
           response1 = self.invoke(config_service, {'key':'mykey1'}, as_bunch=True)
           response3 = self.invoke(config_service, {'key':'mykey3'}, as_bunch=True)
           
           self.logger.info('value1:[{}]'.format(response1.config.value))
           self.logger.info('value3:[{}]'.format(response3.config.value))
       
::    

   INFO - value1:[myvalue1]
   INFO - value3:[err]

Pulling config from any sources using hooks
-------------------------------------------

You have access to a range of :doc:`hooks <./service-hooks>` that let you plug
into a lifecycle of a service so you can fetch configuration from data 
sources outside of Zato if need be.

In particular, before_add_to_store is a good candidate
because this static method is executed well before a service this method is part of
is first time invoked. As such, it can be used to pull config data and assign it to class
it is a method of.

Again, remember that there is no guarantee with regards to the order in which
services are deployed on servers.

::

   from zato.server.service import Service
   
   class MyConfigService(Service):
   
       # The config is initially empty but it will be populated in before_add_to_store
       config = {}
   
       class SimpleIO(object):
           response_elem = 'config'
           input_required = ('key',)
           output_required = ('value',)
   
       def handle(self):
           self.response.payload.value = self.config.get(self.request.input.key, 'err')
           
       @staticmethod
       def before_add_to_store(logger):
           # Imagine LDAP or any other data source is queried here and it returns
           # a dictionary of configuration.
           external_config = get_config()
           
           # Set config to whatever was fetched
           MyConfigService2.config.update(external_config)
           
           # Always return True if you want for the service to be deployed
           return True
