Cassandra CQL
===================

.. _progguide-examples-cassandra-ad-hoc:

Ad-hoc queries
--------------

Ad-hoc queries against
:doc:`Cassandra connection <../../web-admin/conn-def/cassandra>`
definitions
can be constructed and executed at any time. The flexibility of being
able to dynamically create them on fly comes at a cost of decreased performance - execution time will increase.

::

  from zato.server.service import Service

  class MyService(Service):

      def handle(self):

          # Obtains a connection the named pool
          conn = self.cassandra_conn['My Connection'].conn

          # Executes an ad-hoc query and obtains result
          result = conn.execute('SELECT * FROM schema_columns')

          # Let's find out what we have here..
          for row in result:
              self.logger.info(row)

::

  INFO - {'index_type': None, 'validator': 'org.apache.cassandra.db.marshal.Int32Type' ..
  INFO - {index_type': None, 'validator': 'org.apache.cassandra.db.marshal.UTF8Type' ..


.. _progguide-examples-cassandra-templates:

Pre-compiled query templates
----------------------------

Query templates can be
:doc:`compiled <../../web-admin/query/cassandra>`
upfront before any services start to make use of them. Such queries will execute faster but won't be as flexible
as ad-hoc ones because they cannot be constructed dynamically in run-time.

::

  from zato.server.service import Service

  class MyService(Service):

      def handle(self):

          # Obtains a pre-compiled query
          query = self.cassandra_query['Get Customers']

          # Execute the query providing a dictionary of input parameters it expects
          result = query.execute(cust_name='Smith', account_type='SOHO')

          # Let's check out what the query returned
          for item in result:
              self.logger.info(item)

::

  INFO - {'cust_name': 'Alexis Smith', 'account_no': '387017'}
  INFO - {'cust_name': 'Mark Smith', 'account_no': '732561'}
