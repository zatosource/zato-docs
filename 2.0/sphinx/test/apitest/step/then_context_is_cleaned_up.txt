Then context is cleaned up
==========================

Usage example
-------------

::

    Feature: zato-apitest docs

    Scenario: Then context is cleaned up

        Given address "http://apitest-demo.zato.io"
        Given URL path "/demo/xml"
        Given format "XML"
        Given namespace prefix "cust" of "http://example.com/crm"

        When the URL is invoked

        Then context is cleaned up

    Scenario: Start afresh

        Given address "http://apitest-demo.zato.io"
        Given URL path "/demo/xml"
        Given format "XML"

        When the URL is invoked

        Then context is cleaned up

Discussion
----------

-  ``Then context is cleaned up`` cleans up any scenario-specific data,
   such as namespaces or date formats. Without it, they are carried over
   to subsequent scenarios.

-  In the example, prefix "cust" would be available in the second
   scenario even without defining it explicitly had it not been for
   ``Then context is cleaned up``.
