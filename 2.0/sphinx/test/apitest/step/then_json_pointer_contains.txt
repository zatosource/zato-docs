Then JSON Pointer "{path}" contains "{value}"
==============================================

Usage example
-------------

::

    Feature: zato-apitest docs

    Scenario: Then JSON Pointer "{path}" contains "{value}"

        Given address "http://apitest-demo.zato.io"
        Given URL path "/demo/json"
        Given format "JSON"

        When the URL is invoked

        Then JSON Pointer "/hello" contains "{"a":"a", "b":"b"}"

Discussion
----------

/hello must be a JSON iterable, such as list - each element of the iterable
will be consulted for equality with the value provided inline in the step.

Assertion error is raised if none of the elements in iterable matches the inline JSON.
