Then I store "{path}" from response under "{name}", default "{default}"
=======================================================================

Usage example
-------------

::

    Feature: zato-apitest docs

    Scenario: Then I store "{path}" from response under "{name}", default "{default}"

        Given address "http://apitest-demo.zato.io"
        Given URL path "/demo/json"
        Given format "JSON"

        When the URL is invoked

        Then I store "/hmm" from response under "my-variable", default "in-case-it-doesnt-exist"

    Scenario: Has access to variables

        Given address "http://apitest-demo.zato.io"
        Given URL path "/demo/json"
        Given request "{}"
        Given JSON pointer "/foo" in request is "#my-variable"

        When the URL is invoked

        Then status is "200"

Discussion
----------

-  Stores values of paths, either JSON Pointers or XPath, under labels,
   for the duration of a single test case (feature)
-  A default value will be used if the response doesn't contain a path
   provided
-  Values can be referred to via their labels by prefixing them with a
   '#' sign
-  This lets one define a config-like scenario as the first one to pull
   all the necessary that will be referred to in subsequent scenarios
