Pub/sub - Administration - Consumers
====================================

Consumers represent external applications that either Zato delivers publications to
or applications that poll for new messages in topics they are interested in.

A consumer is identified through its :doc:`HTTP Basic Auth credentials <../../web-admin/security/basic-auth>` and subscription
key - that is,
to create a consumer for a topic:

* Create its HTTP Basic Auth credentials under a chosen name
* :doc:`Assign <../../web-admin/pubsub/consumer>` the credentials to the topic
* Note the automatically generated subscription key that consumers need to :doc:`provide in REST requests <../dev/consumer>`

A subscription key is unique for a consumer/topic pair - even if the same application is consuming messages from multiple
topics, it will have a separate subscription key for each one.

Like :doc:`producers <./producer>`, consumers are only mappings between usernames and topics and  they cannot exist in isolation
from topics. When a topic is deleted, its consumers, as well as producers, will be deleted as well.

An application can be both a producer and a consumer, even for the same topic, and all of the access privileges are
handled by Zato separately, including the ability to add or delete them without disrupting the other ones.

If an application is to use multiple topics, it needs to be made a consumer for each one.

Consumers can be made inactive - such producers cannot read messages from the topic they are inactive with.

If consumers are in Pull mode, they periodically :doc:`invoke <../dev/consumer>` a dedicated URL to fetch a batch of messages.
If they work in Callback URL mode, the endpoint for Zato to invoke must be registered in
:doc:`outgoing plain HTTP connections <../../web-admin/outgoing/plain-http>`.

Consumers need to either acknowledge or reject messages they receive - if they don't, the messages will be kept in per-consumer
in-flight message queues that can be cleared if need be in order to prevent Redis from growing indefinitely and consuming all the RAM.

After a message is published, all of its consumers must acknowledge or reject it. Only then the RAM the message uses in Redis is freed up.
