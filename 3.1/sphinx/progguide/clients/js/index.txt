Zato JavaScript client
======================

Overview
========

Zato offers an NPM package with a WebSocket-based JavaScript client that lets one invoke services and participate
in publish/subscribe processes.

The pub/sub part of the client is a wrapper around the WebSocket API with
:doc:`its own additional documentation <../../../pubsub/api/wsx>`.

Installation
============

Add the NPM `zato-js-client <>`_ to your project's dependencies.

GitHub
======

If you would like to check the client's source code, it is available `on GitHub <https://github.com/zatosource/zato-js-client>`_.

Prerequisites
=============

Before a WSX channel for clients can be created, one needs to upload a new service that will act as a configuration gateway,
allowing the client to invoke only selected services.

The service subclasses *zato.server.service.internal.helpers.WebSocketsGateway* which actually does the whole work, and one needs only
to specify a list of services allowed.

In this way, each client may be given a subset of services that it should have access to.

For instance, the configuration below will let a client invoke services 'zato.ping' and 'zato.ping2' and none other of possibly
many services available through servers.

.. highlight:: python

::

  # -*- coding: utf-8 -*-

  # Zato
  from zato.server.service.internal.helpers import WebSocketsGateway

  class MyWSXGateway(WebSocketsGateway):

      # Give the service a unique name
      name = 'my.wsx.gateway'

      # Only these services may be invoked
      services_allowed = [
          'zato.ping',
          'zato.ping2',
      ]

In web-admin
============

* Create :doc:`HTTP Basic Auth <../../../web-admin/security/basic-auth>` credentials to use by the client
* Create a :doc:`WSX channel <../../../web-admin/channels/wsx>` and make sure that it uses the service uploaded in
  the previous step, e.g.:

  .. image:: /gfx/progguide/clients/js/create-wsx-channel.png

JavaScript
==========

Once the NPM `zato-js-client <>`_ package is installed, the clients usage follows a few principles:

* Several attributes can be configured before the client is created
* One client may invoke multiple services or publish and subscribe messages to and from multiple topics
* Client will reconnect automatically if the server drops connection for any reason
* If the client is used from a web browser and the browser is restarted or page refreshed (F5, Ctrl-R),
  the client will not persist and a new client will not automatically have access to previous client instance's
  pub/sub subscriptions, if any were created

Configurable attributes
-----------------------

Basic connection details
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. highlight:: javascript

::

  // Zato client object
  let client = ZatoWSXClient();

  // A unique ID representing this very client
  const client_id = Math.random().toString(24) + '-' + new Date().toISOString();

  // A human-readable name of the client, does not have to be unique,
  const client_name = 'My API client';

  // Where to find the Zato WSX channel
  const address = 'ws://localhost:50103/myapi'

  // Basic Auth credentials created previously
  const username = 'username1';
  const secret = 'secret1';

  // Fill out configuration
  client.client_id = client_id;
  client.client_name = client_name;
  client.address = address;
  client.username = username;
  client.secret = secret;

Callbacks
~~~~~~~~~

Each client needs to be supplied with two callback functions, invoked in specific situations:

* When the client connects or reconnects to a Zato channel

.. highlight:: javascript

::

  function when_ready(client) {
    console.log('Connected to '+ client.address);
  }

* Each time a message from Zato is received, either a notification or a response to a previously sent request

.. highlight:: javascript

::

  // A callback function to be invoked for each message received from Zato
  function on_message_received(client, msg, in_reply_to) {

    // Serialize to JSON for logging purposes
    const msg_as_string = JSON.stringify(msg);

    // If there is 'in_reply_to', this message must be a response to a previous request ..
    if(in_reply_to) {
        console.log('Response received' + msg_as_string);
    }

    // .. otherwise, this is a request, a notification, from server.
    else {
      console.log('Request received' + msg_as_string);
    }
  }

The callback functions need to be assigned to a previously created client instance:

.. highlight:: javascript

::

  let client = ZatoWSXClient();

  // (Skip basic configuration options here)
  ...

  // This will be invoked when the client connects
  client.when_ready = when_ready;

  // This will be invoked each time a message from Zato is received
  client.on_message_received = on_message_received;

----------------

How to connect
--------------

::

  let client = ZatoWSXClient();

  // Provide configuration here
  ...

  // Issue a call that will connect to the server
  client.connect();

  // For how long to wait for the connection - each iteration is 100 ms,
  // hence 20000 * 100 ms = wait for up to 2000 seconds (~30 minutes).
  const iters = 20000;

  // Wait for the connection - once it is established,
  // the client's when_ready callback will be invoked.
  client.wait_until_ready(iters);


How to invoke services
----------------------

::

  let client = ZatoWSXClient();

  // Configure and connect the client here
  ...

  // Create a unique message ID for that request
  const msg_id = client.new_message_id();

  // Service to invoke
  const service = 'my.service';

  // Request for the service
  const request = {'Hello': 'Zato'};

  // Invoke the server - once the response arrives,
  // the client's on_message_received callback will be invoked.
  client.invoke(service, request, msg_id);

How to subscribe to messages
----------------------------

::

  let client = ZatoWSXClient();

  // Configure and connect the client here
  ...

  const topic = '/my/topic';

  // This can be used if the client is subscribing the first time
  client.subscribe(topic);

  // This can be used if the client was already subscribed
  // and the subscription still exists on server, e.g.
  // if the connection between client or server was temporarily
  // disrupted this method should be used because it will reuse
  // the previous subscription instead of creating a new one.
  client.subscribe_or_resume(topic);

  // This can be used to resume a subscription without trying
  // to create a new one if it did not exist. It is required
  // that the previous subscription key be known here.
  const sub_key = '...';

  client.resume(sub_key, topic);


How to publish messages
-----------------------

Note that the metadata 'ctx' object contains fields, such as in_reply_to or priority that are
:doc:`documented separately <../../../pubsub/api/wsx>`..

::

  let client = ZatoWSXClient();

  // Configure and connect the client here
  ...

  // Method .publish accepts a topic name to publish a message to
  // as well as a set of metadata fields - in this example only
  // message priority and MIME type will be set in the ctx object.
  const topic = '/my/topic';

  const ctx = {
    'priority': 7,
    'mime_type': 'text/csv',
  }

  // Data to publish - note that it cae
  const data = 'my,csv,data';

  // Publish the message now along with its metadata
  client.publish(topic, data, ctx);

How to unsubscribe
------------------

::

  let client = ZatoWSXClient();

  // Configure and connect the client here
  ...

  // Call a method to delete an already existing subscription
  // using a previously obtained subscription key to a known topic.
  client.unsubscribe(sub_key, topic);

How to disconnect
-----------------

::

  let client = ZatoWSXClient();

  // Configure and connect the client here
  ...

  // Call a method to disconnect the client - this will
  // send reason code 1000 and a message indicating which
  // client it is that closed the connection.
  client.disconnect();
