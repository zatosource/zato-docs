Outgoing connections - Plain HTTP
=================================

Overview
--------

Used to create, update, delete and browse through outgoing plain HTTP connections.

A plain HTTP connection is a means to synchronously invoke HTTP resources.
Contrary to what :doc:`SOAP connections <./soap>` assume, plain HTTP ones don't except
the data to be send in any particular format, it can be anything that can be
transferred over HTTP, including JSON, CSV, XML or virtually anything.

Active              Whether the connection can be used by services or not. 

                    If a connection is not active a service will encounter a 
                    `zato.common.Inactive <https://github.com/zatosource/zato/blob/master/code/zato-common/src/zato/common/__init__.py>`_
                    exception when attempting to use it.
                    
                    Note that an inactive connection still can be

Ping method         (New in 1.2) HTTP method to use for pinging the connection (defaults to HEAD).
Pool size           (New in 1.2) How big an underlying connection pool can be, any requests above it will be discarded and a warning
                    will be logged. This setting is per each server worker and connections are created on demand, when they're actually
                    needed.
Security            Name of a security definition - 
                    :doc:`HTTP Basic Auth <../security/basic-auth>`,

                    - to use for accessing the resource. 
                    
                    Pick 'No security' explicitly to indicate that no such definition
                    should be used.

Ping
----

.. image:: /gfx/web-admin/outgoing/plain-http-soap-ping.png

A connection can be pinged - this sends an HTTP request (HEAD by default) from one of a 
cluster's servers to a location specified by the connection's definition. 
This can be used to check whether a given resource is reachable by Zato servers.

The feature is available even if a connection is inactive.
