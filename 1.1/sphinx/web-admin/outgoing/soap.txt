that a service intends to send XML.

Active              Whether the connection can be used by services or not. 

                    If a connection is not active a service will encounter a 
                    `zato.common.Inactive <https://github.com/zatosource/zato/blob/master/code/zato-common/src/zato/common/__init__.py>`_
                    exception when attempting to use it.
                    
                    Note that an inactive connection still can be 
                    :ref:`pinged <web-admin-outgoing-soap-ping>`.
                    
Host                HTTP server's host, may include a port
URL path            Path a service to be invoked is mounted on
SOAP action         SOAP action a service to be invoked uses

                    will be logged. This setting is per each server worker and connections are created on demand, when they're actually
                    needed.
Security            Name of a security definition - 
                    :doc:`HTTP Basic Auth <../security/basic-auth>`,

                    Pick 'No security' explicitly to indicate that no such definition
                    should be used.

Ping
----

.. image:: /gfx/web-admin/outgoing/plain-http-soap-ping.png

A connection can be pinged - this sends an HTTP request (HEAD by default) from one of a 
cluster's servers to a location specified by the connection's definition. 
This can be used to check whether a given resource is reachable by Zato servers.

The feature is available even if a connection is inactive.
