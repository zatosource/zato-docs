Channels - AMQP
===============

Overview
--------

Used to create, update, delete and browse through AMQP channels.

Each channel represents a connection through which AMQP broker messages are 
received by Zato. A given service is invoked for each message received.

Creating or updating a channel (re-)establishes a connection to an AMQP broker
and there are as many connectors and connections to any broker as there are 
active channels and :doc:`outgoing connections <../outgoing/amqp>` using it. 

For instance, if there is 1 
:doc:`AMQP definition <../conn-def/amqp>` and 5 channels using it, there will
be 5 connector processes started in a cluster each maintaining 1 connection
to the broker pointed to by the definition.

Reading messages off a queue and invoking a service is an asynchronous
activity - messages are not rolled back onto queues if there are any errors
along.

Consumer tag prefix Each channel can be given a prefix that can be used to
                    tell channels apart from AMQP's end, e.g. each Zato 
                    environment can use a different one
Service             Name of an already existing service to invoke for
                    each AMQP message received
Data format         *(Optional)* The expected data format Zato should parse
                    incoming messages as. This will also populate a service's
                    :ref:`data_format attribute <progguide-write-service-data_format>`.

Delete
------

Stops a channel's connector and deletes the channel from ODB.

.. _web-admin-channels-amqp-active:
  
The 'Active' flag
-----------------

If a channel is made inactive, its underlying AMQP connection will be stopped
but the connector itself will be still running.
