Updates a definition's password - the password is stored in the ODB along with
other details of a security definition. This is not a required field and the password
can be omitted altogether if it's not needed at all.

  It needs to be emphasized that any plain HTTP or SOAP channels and outgoing
  connections that were using the definition will also be deleted automatically.
