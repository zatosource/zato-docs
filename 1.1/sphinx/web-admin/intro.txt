Introducing the web admin panel
===============================

Zato ships with a web admin panel and while certain admin tasks are performed
by 
:doc:`editing config files <../admin/guide/install-config/overview>`,
:doc:`using command line interface <../admin/cli/index>`
or 
:doc:`invoking the API <../public-api/intro>`,
most of the time you'll spend with Zato will most likely fall on the web admin.

While the other means of administration are usually concerned with preparing 
static configuration of an environment or making sure operating system-level 
packages are playing nicely together, the web admin is used to manage most aspects
of already existing clusters and services.

.. note ::

  A key feature of web admin is that almost all changes you make are always automatically 
  introduced on all servers and other components.  **No restarts are usually required**.
  
  Almost everything is always hot-reconfigured. There is no concept of a downtime 
  due to configuration reload. A load-balancer takes care of distributing load
  to servers which need more time to update their config.
