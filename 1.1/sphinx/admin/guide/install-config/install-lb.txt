Installing the load-balancer
============================

Steps
-----

* Prepare crypto material, in PEM, with no passwords, for the load-balancer to use:

  * Public key
  * Private key
  * Certificate
  * A list of CA certificates the load-balancer can trust
  
  Note that Zato ships with :doc:`a simple CA <../../cli/ca>` 
  that can be used on development environments.
  
* Issue the :doc:`zato create load_balancer <../../cli/create-load-balancer>` command
