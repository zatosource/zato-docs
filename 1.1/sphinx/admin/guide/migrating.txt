Migrating between releases
==========================

Overview
--------

Zato releases can be migrated upwards one release at a time. 

Migrating across multiple releases is not supported and there is no support for downgrading either
- in such situations you need to install a desired version from scratch.


From 1.0 to 1.1
---------------

* :doc:`Install Zato binaries <./install-zato>` alongside 1.0 on each host any
  Zato component is on
  
* If using quickstart clusters - open zato-qs-start.sh and zato-qs-stop.sh scripts
  and set ZATO_BIN to zato, so its reads:
  
  :: 
  
    ZATO_BIN=zato
    
* Use 
  :doc:`zato stop <../cli/stop>`
  and
  :doc:`zato start <../cli/start>`
  to restart each component one by one - environments created with Zato 1.0
  can still use 1.1 binaries
  
* (end of steps)
