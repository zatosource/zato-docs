zato start
==========

Overview
------------

Starts a Zato component. 

If the component is a server and it's the first time it's started,
a Zato administrator will have to make the server known to the load-balancer before
the server will be able to accept HTTP connections.

A server that is the first one in a cluster to have been started will automatically
start scheduler and outgoing connectors, if any have been configured for the cluster.
