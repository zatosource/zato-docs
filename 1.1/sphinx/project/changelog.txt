2.0 - Currently in development
==============================

* Check out `2.0 documentation <https://zato.io/docs/2.0/>`_ for details


1.1 - 2013-06-02
================

* `Download 1.1 here <https://zato.io/download/zato-1.1.tar.bz2>`_
* Unified :doc:`installer <../admin/guide/install-zato>` for Ubuntu, Mint, Fedora and OS X
* Added the :doc:`zato check-config <../admin/cli/check-config>` command
* Fixed a bug which lead to double execution of user-defined scheduler jobs
* Made quickstart clusters more robust when confronted with improperly configured servers,
  sanity checks are now performed before servers are started
* Changed the default value of :ref:`main.deployment_lock_expires <admin-guide-config-server-main.deployment_lock_expires>`
  so it works on 32-bit systems without a need for reconfiguring servers after they're
  created
* Made scripts generated by :doc:`zato quickstart <../admin/cli/quickstart>` relocatable
* Newly created servers start CPU_COUNT 
  `gunicorn <http://gunicorn.org>`_
  :ref:`workers <admin-guide-config-server-main.gunicorn_workers>`
  by default now, not CPU_COUNT * 2 as previously
* HAProxy load-balancer can now bind to all interfaces. Patch provided by 
  `Myroslav Opyr <http://talk.quintagroup.com/blogs/myroslav>`_
